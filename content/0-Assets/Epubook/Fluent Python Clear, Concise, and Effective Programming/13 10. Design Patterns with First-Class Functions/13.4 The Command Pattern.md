# The Command Pattern

Command is another design pattern that can be simplified by the use of functions passed as arguments. [Figure 10-2](#command_uml) shows the arrangement of classes in the Command pattern.

###### Figure 10-2. UML class diagram for menu-driven text editor implemented with the Command design pattern. Each command may have a different receiver: the object that implements the action. For `PasteCommand`, the receiver is the Document. For `OpenCommand`, the receiver is the application.

The goal of Command is to decouple an object that invokes an operation (the invoker) from the provider object that implements it (the receiver). In the example from _Design Patterns_, each invoker is a menu item in a graphical application, and the receivers are the document being edited or the application itself.

The idea is to put a `Command` object between the two, implementing an interface with a single method, `execute`, which calls some method in the receiver to perform the desired operation. That way the invoker does not need to know the interface of the receiver, and different receivers can be adapted through different `Command` subclasses. The invoker is configured with a concrete command and calls its `execute` method to operate it. Note in [Figure 10-2](#command_uml) that `MacroCommand` may store a sequence of commands; its `execute()` method calls the same method in each command stored.

Quoting from _Design Patterns_, “Commands are an object-oriented replacement for callbacks.” The question is: do we need an object-oriented replacement for callbacks? Sometimes yes, but not always.

Instead of giving the invoker a `Command` instance, we can simply give it a function. Instead of calling `command.execute()`, the invoker can just call `command()`. The `MacroCommand` can be implemented with a class implementing `__call__`. Instances of `MacroCommand` would be callables, each holding a list of functions for future invocation, as implemented in [Example 10-10](#ex_macro_command).

##### Example 10-10. Each instance of `MacroCommand` has an internal list of commands

```

```

Building a list from the `commands` arguments ensures that it is iterable and keeps a local copy of the command references in each `MacroCommand` instance.

When an instance of `MacroCommand` is invoked, each command in `self.commands` is called in sequence.

More advanced uses of the Command pattern—to support undo, for example—may require more than a simple callback function. Even then, Python provides a couple of alternatives that deserve consideration:

- A callable instance like `MacroCommand` in [Example 10-10](#ex_macro_command) can keep whatever state is necessary, and provide extra methods in addition to `__call__`.
    
- A closure can be used to hold the internal state of a function between calls.
    

This concludes our rethinking of the Command pattern with first-class functions. At a high level, the approach here was similar to the one we applied to Strategy: replacing with callables the instances of a participant class that implemented a single-method interface. After all, every Python callable implements a single-method interface, and that method is named `__call__`.
