# Closures

In the blogosphere, closures are sometimes confused with anonymous functions. Many confuse them because of the parallel history of those features: defining functions inside functions is not so common or convenient, until you have anonymous functions. And closures only matter when you have nested functions. So a lot of people learn both concepts at the same time.

Actually, a closure is a function—let’s call it `f`—with an extended scope that encompasses variables referenced in the body of `f` that are not global variables or local variables of `f`. Such variables must come from the local scope of an outer function that encompasses `f`.

It does not matter whether the function is anonymous or not; what matters is that it can access nonglobal variables that are defined outside of its body.

This is a challenging concept to grasp, and is better approached through an example.

Consider an `avg` function to compute the mean of an ever-growing series of values; for example, the average closing price of a commodity over its entire history. Every day a new price is added, and the average is computed taking into account all prices so far.

Starting with a clean slate, this is how `avg` could be used:

```
>>> 
```

Where does `avg` come from, and where does it keep the history of previous values?

For starters, [Example 9-7](#ex_average_oo) is a class-based implementation.

##### Example 9-7. average_oo.py: a class to calculate a running average

```
class
```

The `Averager` class creates instances that are callable:

```
>>> 
```

Now, [Example 9-8](#ex_average_fn) is a functional implementation, using the higher-order function `make_averager`.

##### Example 9-8. average.py: a higher-order function to calculate a running average

```
def
```

When invoked, `make_averager` returns an `averager` function object. Each time an `averager` is called, it appends the passed argument to the series, and computes the current average, as shown in [Example 9-9](#ex_average_demo1).

##### Example 9-9. Testing [Example 9-8](#ex_average_fn)

```
>>> 
```

Note the similarities of the examples: we call `Averager()` or `make_averager()` to get a callable object `avg` that will update the historical series and calculate the current mean. In [Example 9-7](#ex_average_oo), `avg` is an instance of `Averager`, and in [Example 9-8](#ex_average_fn), it is the inner function, `averager`. Either way, we just call `avg(n)` to include `n` in the series and get the updated mean.

It’s obvious where the `avg` of the `Averager` class keeps the history: the `self.series` instance attribute. But where does the `avg` function in the second example find the `series`?

Note that `series` is a local variable of `make_averager` because the assignment `series = []` happens in the body of that function. But when `avg(10)` is called, `make_averager` has already returned, and its local scope is long gone.

Within `averager`, `series` is a _free variable_. This is a technical term meaning a variable that is not bound in the local scope. See [Figure 9-1](#closure_fig).

###### Figure 9-1. The closure for `averager` extends the scope of that function to include the binding for the free variable series.

Inspecting the returned `averager` object shows how Python keeps the names of local and free variables in the `__code__` attribute that represents the compiled body of the function. [Example 9-10](#ex_average_demo2) demonstrates.

##### Example 9-10. Inspecting the function created by `make_averager` in [Example 9-8](#ex_average_fn)

```
>>> 
```

The value for `series` is kept in the `__closure__` attribute of the returned function `avg`. Each item in `avg.__closure__` corresponds to a name in `avg.​__code__​.co_freevars`. These items are `cells`, and they have an attribute called `cell_contents` where the actual value can be found. [Example 9-11](#ex_average_demo3) shows these attributes.

##### Example 9-11. Continuing from [Example 9-9](#ex_average_demo1)

```
>>> 
```

To summarize: a closure is a function that retains the bindings of the free variables that exist when the function is defined, so that they can be used later when the function is invoked and the defining scope is no longer available.

Note that the only situation in which a function may need to deal with external variables that are nonglobal is when it is nested in another function and those variables are part of the local scope of the outer function.
