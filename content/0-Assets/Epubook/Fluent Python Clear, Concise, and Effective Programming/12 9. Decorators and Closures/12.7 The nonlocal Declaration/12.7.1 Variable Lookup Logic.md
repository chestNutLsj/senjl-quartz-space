## Variable Lookup Logic

When a function is defined, the Python bytecode compiler determines how to fetch a variable `x` that appears in it, based on these rules:[^3]

- If there is a `global x` declaration, `x` comes from and is assigned to the `x` global variable module.[^4]
    
- If there is a `nonlocal x` declaration, `x` comes from and is assigned to the `x` local variable of the nearest surrounding function where `x` is defined.
    
- If `x` is a parameter or is assigned a value in the function body, then `x` is the local variable.
    
- If `x` is referenced but is not assigned and is not a parameter:
    
    - `x` will be looked up in the local scopes of the surrounding function bodies (nonlocal scopes).
        
    - If not found in surrounding scopes, it will be read from the module global scope.
        
    - If not found in the global scope, it will be read from `__builtins__.__dict__`.
        

Now that we have Python closures covered, we can effectively implement decorators with nested functions.
