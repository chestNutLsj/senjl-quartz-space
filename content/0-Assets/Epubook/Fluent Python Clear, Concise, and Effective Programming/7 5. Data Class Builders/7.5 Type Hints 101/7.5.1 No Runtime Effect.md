## No Runtime Effect

Think about Python type hints as “documentation that can be verified by IDEs and type checkers.”

That’s because type hints have no impact on the runtime behavior of Python programs. Check out [Example 5-9](#no_runtime_check_ex).

I told you: no type checking at runtime!

If you type the code of [Example 5-9](#no_runtime_check_ex) in a Python module, it will run and display a meaningless `Coordinate`, with no error or warning:

$ python3 nocheck_demo.py
Coordinate`(``lat``=``'Ni!'`, `lon``=`None`)`

The type hints are intended primarily to support third-party type checkers, like [Mypy](https://fpy.li/mypy) or the [PyCharm IDE](https://fpy.li/5-5) built-in type checker. These are static analysis tools: they check Python source code “at rest,” not running code.

To see the effect of type hints, you must run one of those tools on your code—like a linter. For instance, here is what Mypy has to say about the previous example:

$ mypy nocheck_demo.py
nocheck_demo.py:8: error: Argument `1` to `"Coordinate"` has
incompatible `type` `"str"``;` expected `"float"`
nocheck_demo.py:8: error: Argument `2` to `"Coordinate"` has
incompatible `type` `"None"``;` expected `"float"`

As you can see, given the definition of `Coordinate`, Mypy knows that both arguments to create an instance must be of type `float`, but the assignment to `trash` uses a `str` and `None`.[^5]

Now let’s talk about the syntax and meaning of type hints.
