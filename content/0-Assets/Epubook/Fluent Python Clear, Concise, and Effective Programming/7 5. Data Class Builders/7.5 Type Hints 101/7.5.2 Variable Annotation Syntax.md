## Variable Annotation Syntax

Both `typing.NamedTuple` and `@dataclass` use the syntax of variable annotations defined in [PEP 526](https://fpy.li/pep526). This is a quick introduction to that syntax in the context defining attributes in `class` statements.

The basic syntax of variable annotation is:

```
var_name
```

The [“Acceptable type hints” section in PEP 484](https://fpy.li/5-6) explains what are acceptable types, but in the context of defining a data class, these types are more likely to be useful:

- A concrete class, for example, `str` or `FrenchDeck`
    
- A parameterized collection type, like `list[int]`, `tuple[str, float]`, etc.
    
- `typing.Optional`, for example, `Optional[str]`—to declare a field that can be a `str` or `None`
    

You can also initialize the variable with a value. In a `typing.NamedTuple` or `@dataclass` declaration, that value will become the default for that attribute if the corresponding argument is omitted in the constructor call:

```
var_name
```
