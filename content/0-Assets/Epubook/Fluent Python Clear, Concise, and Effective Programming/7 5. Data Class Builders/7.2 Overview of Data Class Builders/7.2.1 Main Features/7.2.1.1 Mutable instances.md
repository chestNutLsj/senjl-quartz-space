### Mutable instances

A key difference between these class builders is that `collections.namedtuple` and `typing.NamedTuple` build `tuple` subclasses, therefore the instances are immutable. By default, `@dataclass` produces mutable classes. But the decorator accepts a keyword argument `frozen`—shown in [Example 5-3](#coord_dataclas_ex). When `frozen=True`, the class will raise an exception if you try to assign a value to a field after the instance is initialized.
