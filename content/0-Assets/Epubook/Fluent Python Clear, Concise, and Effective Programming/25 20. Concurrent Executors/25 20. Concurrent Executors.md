# Chapter 20. Concurrent Executors

> The people bashing threads are typically system programmers which have in mind use cases that the typical application programmer will never encounter in her life. [...] In 99% of the use cases an application programmer is likely to run into, the simple pattern of spawning a bunch of independent threads and collecting the results in a queue is everything one needs to know.

This chapter focuses on the `concurrent.futures.Executor` classes that encapsulate the pattern of “spawning a bunch of independent threads and collecting the results in a queue,” described by Michele Simionato. The concurrent executors make this pattern almost trivial to use, not only with threads but also with processes—useful for compute-intensive tasks.

Here I also introduce the concept of _futures_—objects representing the asynchronous execution of an operation, similar to JavaScript promises. This primitive idea is the foundation not only of `concurrent.futures` but also of the `asyncio` package, the subject of [Chapter 21](ch21.html#async_ch).
