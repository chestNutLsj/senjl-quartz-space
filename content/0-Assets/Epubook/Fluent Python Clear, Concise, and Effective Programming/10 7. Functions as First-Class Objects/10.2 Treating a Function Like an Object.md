# Treating a Function Like an Object

The console session in [Example 7-1](#func_object_demo) shows that Python functions are objects. Here we create a function, call it, read its `__doc__` attribute, and check that the function object itself is an instance of the `function` class.

##### Example 7-1. Create and test a function, then read its `__doc__` and check its type

```
>>> 
```

This is a console session, so we’re creating a function at “runtime.”

`__doc__` is one of several attributes of function objects.

`factorial` is an instance of the `function` class.

The `__doc__` attribute is used to generate the help text of an object. In the Python console, the command `help(factorial)` will display a screen like [Figure 7-1](#factorial_help).

###### Figure 7-1. Help screen for `factorial`; the text is built from the `__doc__` attribute of the function.

[Example 7-2](#func_object_demo2) shows the “first class” nature of a function object. We can assign it a variable `fact` and call it through that name. We can also pass `factorial` as an argument to the [`map`](https://fpy.li/7-3) function. Calling `map(function, iterable)` returns an iterable where each item is the result of calling the first argument (a function) to successive elements of the second argument (an iterable), `range(10)` in this example.

##### Example 7-2. Use `factorial` through a different name, and pass `factorial` as an argument

```

```

Having first-class functions enables programming in a functional style. One of the hallmarks of [functional programming](https://fpy.li/7-4) is the use of higher-order functions, our next topic.
