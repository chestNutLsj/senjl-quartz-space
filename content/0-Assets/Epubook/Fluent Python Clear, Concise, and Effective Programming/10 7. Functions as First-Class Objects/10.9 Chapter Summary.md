# Chapter Summary

The goal of this chapter was to explore the first-class nature of functions in Python. The main ideas are that you can assign functions to variables, pass them to other functions, store them in data structures, and access function attributes, allowing frameworks and tools to act on that information.

Higher-order functions, a staple of functional programming, are common in Python. The `sorted`, `min`, and `max` built-ins, and `functools.partial` are examples of commonly used higher-order functions in the language. Using `map`, `filter`, and `reduce` is not as common as it used to be, thanks to list comprehensions (and similar constructs like generator expressions) and the addition of reducing built-ins like `sum`, `all`, and `any`.

Callables come in nine different flavors since Python 3.6, from the simple functions created with `lambda` to instances of classes implementing `__call__`. Generators and coroutines are also callable, although their behavior is very different from other callables. All callables can be detected by the `callable()` built-in. Callables offer rich syntax for declaring formal parameters, including keyword-only parameters, positional-only parameters, and annotations.

Lastly, we covered some functions from the `operator` module and `functools.partial`, which facilitate functional programming by minimizing the need for the functionally challenged `lambda` syntax.
