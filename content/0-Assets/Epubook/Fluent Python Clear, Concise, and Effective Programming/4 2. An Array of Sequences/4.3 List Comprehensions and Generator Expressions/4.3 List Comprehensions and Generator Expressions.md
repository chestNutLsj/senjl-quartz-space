# List Comprehensions and Generator Expressions

A quick way to build a sequence is using a list comprehension (if the target is a `list`) or a generator expression (for other kinds of sequences). If you are not using these syntactic forms on a daily basis, I bet you are missing opportunities to write code that is more readable and often faster at the same time.

If you doubt my claim that these constructs are “more readable,” read on. I’ll try to convince you.

###### Tip

For brevity, many Python programmers refer to list comprehensions as _listcomps_, and generator expressions as _genexps_. I will use these words as well.
