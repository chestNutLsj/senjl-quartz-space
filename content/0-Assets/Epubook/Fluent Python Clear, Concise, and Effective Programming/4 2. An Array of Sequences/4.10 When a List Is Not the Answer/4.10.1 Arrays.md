## Arrays

If a list only contains numbers, an `array.array` is a more efficient replacement. Arrays support all mutable sequence operations (including `.pop`, `.insert`, and `.extend`), as well as additional methods for fast loading and saving, such as `.frombytes` and `.tofile`.

A Python array is as lean as a C array. As shown in [Figure 2-1](#container_v_flat_img), an `array` of `float` values does not hold full-fledged `float` instances, but only the packed bytes representing their machine values—similar to an array of `double` in the C language. When creating an `array`, you provide a typecode, a letter to determine the underlying C type used to store each item in the array. For example, `b` is the typecode for what C calls a `signed char`, an integer ranging from –128 to 127. If you create an `array('b')`, then each item will be stored in a single byte and interpreted as an integer. For large sequences of numbers, this saves a lot of memory. And Python will not let you put any number that does not match the type for the array.

[Example 2-19](#ex_array_io) shows creating, saving, and loading an array of 10 million floating-point random numbers.

##### Example 2-19. Creating, saving, and loading a large array of floats

```
>>> 
```

[![^1]

Import the `array` type.

[![^2]

Create an array of double-precision floats (typecode `'d'`) from any iterable object—in this case, a generator expression.

[![^3]

Inspect the last number in the array.

[![^4]

Save the array to a binary file.

[![^5]

Create an empty array of doubles.

[![^6]

Read 10 million numbers from the binary file.

[![^7]

Inspect the last number in the array.

[![^8]

Verify that the contents of the arrays match.

As you can see, `array.tofile` and `array.fromfile` are easy to use. If you try the example, you’ll notice they are also very fast. A quick experiment shows that it takes about 0.1 seconds for `array.fromfile` to load 10 million double-precision floats from a binary file created with `array.tofile`. That is nearly 60 times faster than reading the numbers from a text file, which also involves parsing each line with the `float` built-in. Saving with `array.tofile` is about seven times faster than writing one float per line in a text file. In addition, the size of the binary file with 10 million doubles is 80,000,000 bytes (8 bytes per double, zero overhead), while the text file has 181,515,739 bytes for the same data.

For the specific case of numeric arrays representing binary data, such as raster 0-Assets/Epubook/Fluent%20Python%20Clear,%20Concise,%20and%20Effective%20Programming/images, Python has the `bytes` and `bytearray` types discussed in [Chapter 4](ch04.html#strings_bytes_files).

We wrap up this section on arrays with [Table 2-3](#list_x_array_attrs_tbl), comparing the features of `list` and `array.array`.

###### Tip

As of Python 3.10, the `array` type does not have an in-place `sort` method like `list.sort()`. If you need to sort an array, use the built-in `sorted` function to rebuild the array:

```
a
```

To keep a sorted array sorted while adding items to it, use the [`bisect.insort`](https://fpy.li/2-16) function.

If you do a lot of work with arrays and don’t know about `memoryview`, you’re missing out. See the next topic.
