## Concurrency Beyond the Standard Library

_Fluent Python_ focuses on core language features and core parts of the standard library. [_Full Stack Python_](https://fpy.li/19-69) is a great complement to this book: it’s about Python’s ecosystem, with sections titled “Development Environments,” “Data,” “Web Development,” and “DevOps,” among others.

I’ve already mentioned two books that cover concurrency using the Python standard library that also include significant content on third-party libraries and tools: [_High Performance Python_, 2nd ed.](https://fpy.li/19-56) and [_Parallel Programming with Python_](https://fpy.li/19-58). Francesco Pierfederici’s [_Distributed Computing with Python_](https://fpy.li/19-72) (Packt) covers the standard library and also the use of cloud providers and HPC (High-Performance Computing) clusters.

[“Python, Performance, and GPUs”](https://fpy.li/19-73) by Matthew Rocklin is “a status update for using GPU accelerators from Python,” posted in June 2019.

“Instagram currently features the world’s largest deployment of the _Django_ web framework, which is written entirely in Python.” That’s the opening sentence of the blog post, [“Web Service Efficiency at Instagram with Python”](https://fpy.li/19-74), written by Min Ni—a software engineer at Instagram. The post describes metrics and tools Instagram uses to optimize the efficiency of its Python codebase, as well as detect and diagnose performance regressions as it deploys its back end “30-50 times a day.”

[_Architecture Patterns with Python: Enabling Test-Driven Development, Domain-Driven Design, and Event-Driven Microservices_](https://fpy.li/19-75) by Harry Percival and Bob Gregory (O’Reilly) presents architectural patterns for Python server-side applications. The authors also made the book freely available online at [_cosmicpython.com_](https://fpy.li/19-76).

Two elegant and easy-to-use libraries for parallelizing tasks over processes are [_lelo_](https://fpy.li/19-77) by João S. O. Bueno and [_python-parallelize_](https://fpy.li/19-78) by Nat Pryce. The _lelo_ package defines a `@parallel` decorator that you can apply to any function to magically make it unblocking: when you call the decorated function, its execution is started in another process. Nat Pryce’s _python-parallelize_ package provides a `parallelize` generator that distributes the execution of a `for` loop over multiple CPUs. Both packages are built on the _multiprocessing_ library.

Python core developer Eric Snow maintains a [Multicore Python](https://fpy.li/19-79) wiki, with notes about his and other people’s efforts to improve Python’s support for parallel execution. Snow is the author of [PEP 554—Multiple Interpreters in the Stdlib](https://fpy.li/pep554). If approved and implemented, PEP 554 lays the groundwork for future enhancements that may eventually allow Python to use multiple cores without the overheads of _multiprocessing_. One of the biggest blockers is the complex interaction between multiple active subinterpreters and extensions that assume a single interpreter.

Mark Shannon—also a Python maintainer—created a [useful table](https://fpy.li/19-80) comparing concurrent models in Python, referenced in a discussion about subinterpreters between him, Eric Snow, and other developers on the [python-dev](https://fpy.li/19-81) mailing list. In Shannon’s table, the “Ideal CSP” column refers to the theoretical [Communicating sequential processes](https://fpy.li/19-82) model proposed by Tony Hoare in 1978. Go also allows shared objects, violating an essential constraint of CSP: execution units should communicate through message passing through channels.

[_Stackless Python_](https://fpy.li/19-83) (a.k.a. _Stackless_) is a fork of CPython implementing microthreads, which are application-level lightweight threads—as opposed to OS threads. The massively multiplayer online game [_EVE Online_](https://fpy.li/19-84) was built on _Stackless_, and engineers employed by the game company [CCP](https://fpy.li/19-85) were [maintainers of _Stackless_](https://fpy.li/19-86) for a while. Some features of _Stackless_ were reimplemented in the [_Pypy_](https://fpy.li/19-87) interpreter and the [_greenlet_](https://fpy.li/19-14) package, the core technology of the [_gevent_](https://fpy.li/19-17) networking library, which in turn is the foundation of the [_Gunicorn_](https://fpy.li/gunicorn) application server.

The actor model of concurrent programming is at the core of the highly scalable Erlang and Elixir languages, and is also the model of the Akka framework for Scala and Java. If you want to try out the actor model in Python, check out the [_Thespian_](https://fpy.li/19-90) and [_Pykka_](https://fpy.li/19-91) libraries.

My remaining recommendations have few or zero mentions of Python, but are nevertheless relevant to readers interested in the theme of this chapter.
