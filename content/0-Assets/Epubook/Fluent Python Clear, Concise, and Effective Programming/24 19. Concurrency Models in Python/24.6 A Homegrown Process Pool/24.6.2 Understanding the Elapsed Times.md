## Understanding the Elapsed Times

Note that the elapsed time in the first column is for checking that specific number. For example, `is_prime(7777777777777753)` took almost 8.4s to return `True`. Meanwhile, other processes were checking other numbers in parallel.

There were 20 numbers to check. I wrote _procs.py_ to start a number of worker processes equal to the number of CPU cores, as determined by `multiprocessing.cpu_count()`.

The total time in this case is much less than the sum of the elapsed time for the individual checks. There is some overhead in spinning up processes and in inter-process communication, so the end result is that the multiprocess version is only about 4.2 times faster than the sequential. That’s good, but a little disappointing considering the code launches 12 processes to use all cores on this laptop.

###### Note

The `multiprocessing.cpu_count()` function returns `12` on the MacBook Pro I’m using to write this chapter. It’s actually a 6-CPU Core-i7, but the OS reports 12 CPUs because of hyperthreading, an Intel technology which executes 2 threads per core. However, hyperthreading works better when one of the threads is not working as hard as the other thread in the same core—perhaps the first is stalled waiting for data after a cache miss, and the other is crunching numbers. Anyway, there’s no free lunch: this laptop performs like a 6-CPU machine for compute-intensive work that doesn’t use a lot of memory—like that simple primality test.
