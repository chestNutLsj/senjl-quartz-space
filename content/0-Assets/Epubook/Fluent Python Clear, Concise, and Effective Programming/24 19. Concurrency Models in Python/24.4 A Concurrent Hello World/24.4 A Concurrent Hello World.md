# A Concurrent Hello World

During a discussion about threads and how to avoid the GIL, Python contributor Michele Simionato [posted an example](https://fpy.li/19-10) that is like a concurrent “Hello World”: the simplest program to show how Python can “walk and chew gum.”

Simionato’s program uses `multiprocessing`, but I adapted it to introduce `threading` and `asyncio` as well. Let’s start with the `threading` version, which may look familiar if you’ve studied threads in Java or C.
