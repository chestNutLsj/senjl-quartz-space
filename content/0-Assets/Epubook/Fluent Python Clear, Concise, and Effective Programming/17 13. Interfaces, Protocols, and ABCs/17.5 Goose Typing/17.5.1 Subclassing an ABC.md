## Subclassing an ABC

Following Martelli’s advice, we’ll leverage an existing ABC, `collections.MutableSequence`, before daring to invent our own. In [Example 13-6](#ex_pythonic_deck2), `FrenchDeck2` is explicitly declared a subclass of `collections.MutableSequence`.

##### Example 13-6. frenchdeck2.py: `FrenchDeck2`, a subclass of `collections.MutableSequence`

```
from
```

`__setitem__` is all we need to enable shuffling…

[![^2]

…but subclassing `MutableSequence` forces us to implement `__delitem__`, an abstract method of that ABC.

[![^3]

We are also required to implement `insert`, the third abstract method of `MutableSequence`.

Python does not check for the implementation of the abstract methods at import time (when the _frenchdeck2.py_ module is loaded and compiled), but only at runtime when we actually try to instantiate `FrenchDeck2`. Then, if we fail to implement any of the abstract methods, we get a `TypeError` exception with a message such as `"Can't instantiate` `abstract class FrenchDeck2 with abstract methods __delitem__, insert"`. That’s why we must implement `__delitem__` and `insert`, even if our `FrenchDeck2` examples do not need those behaviors: the `MutableSequence` ABC demands them.

As [Figure 13-3](#mutablesequence_uml) shows, not all methods of the `Sequence` and `MutableSequence` ABCs are abstract.

###### Figure 13-3. UML class diagram for the `MutableSequence` ABC and its superclasses from `collections.abc` (inheritance arrows point from subclasses to ancestors; names in italic are abstract classes and abstract methods).

To write `FrenchDeck2` as a subclass of `MutableSequence`, I had to pay the price of implementing `__delitem__` and `insert`, which my examples did not require. In return, `FrenchDeck2` inherits five concrete methods from `Sequence`: `__contains__`, `__iter__`, `__reversed__`, `index`, and `count`. From `MutableSequence`, it gets another six methods: `append`, `reverse`, `extend`, `pop`, `remove`, and `__iadd__`—which supports the `+=` operator for in place concatenation.

The concrete methods in each `collections.abc` ABC are implemented in terms of the public interface of the class, so they work without any knowledge of the internal structure of instances.

###### Tip

As the coder of a concrete subclass, you may be able to override methods inherited from ABCs with more efficient implementations. For example, `__contains__` works by doing a sequential scan of the sequence, but if your concrete sequence keeps its items sorted, you can write a faster `__contains__` that does a binary search using the [`bisect`](https://fpy.li/13-13) function from the standard library. See [“Managing Ordered Sequences with Bisect”](https://fpy.li/bisect) at [_fluentpython.com_]( http://fluentpython.com) to learn more about it.

To use ABCs well, you need to know what’s available. We’ll review the `collections` ABCs next.
