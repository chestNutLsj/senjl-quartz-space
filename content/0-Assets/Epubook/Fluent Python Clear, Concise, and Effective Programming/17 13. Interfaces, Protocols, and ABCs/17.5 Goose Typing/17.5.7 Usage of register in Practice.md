## Usage of register in Practice

In [Example 13-11](#ex_tombolist), we used `Tombola.register` as a class decorator. Prior to Python 3.3, `register` could not be used like that—it had to be called as a plain function after the class definition, as suggested by the comment at the end of [Example 13-11](#ex_tombolist). However, even now, it’s more widely deployed as a function to register classes defined elsewhere. For example, in the [source code](https://fpy.li/13-24) for the `collections.abc` module, the built-in types `tuple`, `str`, `range`, and `memoryview` are registered as virtual subclasses of `Sequence`, like this:

```
Sequence
```

Several other built-in types are registered to ABCs in __collections_abc.py_. Those registrations happen only when that module is imported, which is OK because you’ll have to import it anyway to get the ABCs. For example, you need to import `MutableMapping` from `collections.abc` to perform a check like `isinstance(my_dict, MutableMapping)`.

Subclassing an ABC or registering with an ABC are both explicit ways of making our classes pass `issubclass` checks—as well as `isinstance` checks, which also rely on `issubclass`. But some ABCs support structural typing as well. The next section explains.
