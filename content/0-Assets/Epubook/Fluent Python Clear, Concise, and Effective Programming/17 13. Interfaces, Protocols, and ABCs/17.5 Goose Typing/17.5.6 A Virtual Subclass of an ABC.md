## A Virtual Subclass of an ABC

An essential characteristic of goose typing—and one reason why it deserves a waterfowl name—is the ability to register a class as a _virtual subclass_ of an ABC, even if it does not inherit from it. When doing so, we promise that the class faithfully implements the interface defined in the ABC—and Python will believe us without checking. If we lie, we’ll be caught by the usual runtime exceptions.

This is done by calling a `register` class method on the ABC. The registered class then becomes a virtual subclass of the ABC, and will be recognized as such by `issubclass`, but it does not inherit any methods or attributes from the ABC.

###### Warning

Virtual subclasses do not inherit from their registered ABCs, and are not checked for conformance to the ABC interface at any time, not even when they are instantiated. Also, static type checkers can’t handle virtual subclasses at this time. For details, see [Mypy issue 2922—ABCMeta.register support](https://fpy.li/13-22).

The `register` method is usually invoked as a plain function (see [“Usage of register in Practice”](#register_usage)), but it can also be used as a decorator. In [Example 13-11](#ex_tombolist), we use the decorator syntax and implement `TomboList`, a virtual subclass of `Tombola`, depicted in [Figure 13-7](#tombolist_uml).

###### Figure 13-7. UML class diagram for the `TomboList`, a real subclass of `list` and a virtual subclass of `Tombola`.

##### Example 13-11. tombolist.py: class `TomboList` is a virtual subclass of `Tombola`

```
from
```

[![^1]

`Tombolist` is registered as a virtual subclass of `Tombola`.

[![^2]

`Tombolist` extends `list`.

[![^3]

`Tombolist` inherits its boolean behavior from `list`, and that returns `True` if the list is not empty.

[![^4]

Our `pick` calls `self.pop`, inherited from `list`, passing a random item index.

[![^5]

`Tombolist.load` is the same as `list.extend`.

[![^6]

`loaded` delegates to `bool`.[^14]

[![^7]

It’s always possible to call `register` in this way, and it’s useful to do so when you need to register a class that you do not maintain, but which does fulfill the interface.

Note that because of the registration, the functions `issubclass` and `isinstance` act as if `TomboList` is a subclass of `Tombola`:

```
>>> 
```

However, inheritance is guided by a special class attribute named `__mro__`—the Method Resolution Order. It basically lists the class and its superclasses in the order Python uses to search for methods.[^15] If you inspect the `__mro__` of `TomboList`, you’ll see that it lists only the “real” superclasses—`list` and `object`:

```
>>> 
```

`Tombola` is not in `Tombolist.__mro__`, so `Tombolist` does not inherit any methods from `Tombola`.

This concludes our `Tombola` ABC case study. In the next section, we’ll address how the `register` ABC function is used in the wild.
