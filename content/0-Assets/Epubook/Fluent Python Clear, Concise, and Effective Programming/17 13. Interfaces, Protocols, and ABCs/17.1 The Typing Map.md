# The Typing Map

The four typing approaches depicted in [Figure 13-1](#type_systems_described) are complementary: they have different pros and cons. It doesn’t make sense to dismiss any of them.

###### Figure 13-1. The top half describes runtime type checking approaches using just the Python interpreter; the bottom requires an external static type checker such as MyPy or an IDE like PyCharm. The left quadrants cover typing based on the object’s structure— i.e., the methods provided by the object, regardless of the name of its class or superclasses; the right quadrants depend on objects having explicitly named types: the name of the object’s class, or the name of its superclasses.

Each of these four approaches rely on interfaces to work, but static typing can be done—poorly—using only concrete types instead of interface abstractions like protocols and abstract base classes. This chapter is about duck typing, goose typing, and static duck typing—typing disciplines that revolve around interfaces.

This chapter is split in four main sections, addressing three of the four quadrants in the Typing Map ([Figure 13-1](#type_systems_described)):

- [“Two Kinds of Protocols”](#two_kinds_protocols_sec) compares the two forms of structural typing with protocols—i.e., the lefthand side of the Typing Map.
    
- [“Programming Ducks”](#prog_ducks_sec) dives deeper into Python’s usual duck typing, including how to make it safer while preserving its major strength: flexibility.
    
- [“Goose Typing”](#goose_typing_sec) explains the use of ABCs for stricter runtime type checking. This is the longest section, not because it’s more important, but because there are more sections about duck typing, static duck typing, and static typing elsewhere in the book.
    
- [“Static Protocols”](#static_protocols_sec) covers usage, implementation, and design of `typing.Protocol` subclasses—useful for static and runtime type checking.
