# What’s New in This Chapter

This chapter was heavily edited and is about 24% longer than the corresponding Chapter 11 in the first edition of _Fluent Python_. Although some sections and many paragraphs are the same, there’s a lot of new content. These are the highlights:

- The chapter introduction and the Typing Map ([Figure 13-1](#type_systems_described)) are new. That’s the key to most new content in this chapter—and all other chapters related to typing in Python ≥ 3.8.
    
- [“Two Kinds of Protocols”](#two_kinds_protocols_sec) explains the similarities and differences between dynamic and static protocols.
    
- [“Defensive Programming and ‘Fail Fast’”](#defensive_duck_prog_sec) mostly reproduces content from the first edition, but was updated and now has a section title to highlight its importance.
    
- [“Static Protocols”](#static_protocols_sec) is all new. It builds on the initial presentation in [“Static Protocols”](ch08.html#protocols_in_fn) ([Chapter 8](ch08.html#type_hints_in_def_ch)).
    
- Updated class diagrams of `collections.abc` in Figures [13-2](#sequence_uml_repeat), [13-3](#mutablesequence_uml), and [13-4](#collections_uml) to include the `Collection` ABC, from Python 3.6.
    

The first edition of _Fluent Python_ had a section encouraging use of the `numbers` ABCs for goose typing. In [“The numbers ABCs and Numeric Protocols”](#numbers_abc_proto_sec), I explain why you should use numeric static protocols from the `typing` module instead, if you plan to use static type checkers as well as runtime checks in the style of goose typing.
