### abc.Iterable versus abc.Sequence

Both `math.fsum` and `replacer.zip_replace` must iterate over the entire `Iterable` arguments to return a result. Given an endless iterable such as the `itertools.cycle` generator as input, these functions would consume all memory and crash the Python process. Despite this potential danger, it is fairly common in modern Python to offer functions that accept an `Iterable` input even if they must process it completely to return a result. That gives the caller the option of providing input data as a generator instead of a prebuilt sequence, potentially saving a lot of memory if the number of input items is large.

On the other hand, the `columnize` function from [Example 8-13](#columnize_ex) needs a `Sequence` parameter, and not an `Iterable`, because it must get the `len()` of the input to compute the number of rows up front.

Like `Sequence`, `Iterable` is best used as a parameter type. It’s too vague as a return type. A function should be more precise about the concrete type it returns.

Closely related to `Iterable` is the `Iterator` type, used as a return type in [Example 8-14](#charindex_ex). We’ll get back to it in [Chapter 17](ch17.html#iterables2generators), which is about generators and classic iterators.
