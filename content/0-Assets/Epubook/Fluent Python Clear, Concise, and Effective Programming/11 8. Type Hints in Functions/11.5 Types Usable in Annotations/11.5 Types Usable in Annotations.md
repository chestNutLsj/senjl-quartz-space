# Types Usable in Annotations

Pretty much any Python type can be used in type hints, but there are restrictions and recommendations. In addition, the `typing` module introduced special constructs with semantics that are sometimes surprising.

This section covers all the major types you can use with annotations:

- `typing.Any`
    
- Simple types and classes
    
- `typing.Optional` and `typing.Union`
    
- Generic collections, including tuples and mappings
    
- Abstract base classes
    
- Generic iterables
    
- Parameterized generics and `TypeVar`
    
- `typing.Protocols`—the key to _static duck typing_
    
- `typing.Callable`
    
- `typing.NoReturn`—a good way to end this list
    

We’ll cover each of these in turn, starting with a type that is strange, apparently useless, but crucially important.
