### Tuples as records

If you’re using a `tuple` as a record, use the `tuple` built-in and declare the types of the fields within `[]`.

For example, the type hint would be `tuple[str, float, str]` to accept a tuple with city name, population, and country: `('Shanghai', 24.28, 'China')`.

Consider a function that takes a pair of geographic coordinates and returns a [Geohash](https://fpy.li/8-18), used like this:

```
>>> 
```

[Example 8-11](#geohash_ex_1) shows how `geohash` is defined, using the `geolib` package from PyPI.

##### Example 8-11. _coordinates.py_ with the `geohash` function

This comment stops Mypy from reporting that the `geolib` package doesn’t have type hints.

`lat_lon` parameter annotated as a `tuple` with two `float` fields.

###### Tip

For Python < 3.9, import and use `typing.Tuple` in type hints. It is deprecated but will remain in the standard library at least until 2024.
