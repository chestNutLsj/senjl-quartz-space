# Annotating Positional Only and Variadic Parameters

Recall the `tag` function from [Example 7-9](ch07.html#tagger_ex). The last time we saw its signature was in [“Positional-Only Parameters”](ch07.html#positional_only_params):

```
def
```

Here is `tag`, fully annotated, written in several lines—a common convention for long signatures, with line breaks the way the [_blue_](https://fpy.li/8-10) formatter would do it:

```
from
```

Note the type hint `*content: str` for the arbitrary positional parameters; this means all those arguments must be of type `str`. The type of the `content` local variable in the function body will be `tuple[str, ...]`.

The type hint for the arbitrary keyword arguments is `**attrs: str` in this example, therefore the type of `attrs` inside the function will be `dict[str, str]`. For a type hint like `**attrs: float`, the type of `attrs` in the function would be `dict[str, float]`.``

If the `attrs` parameter must accept values of different types, you’ll need to use a `Union[]` or `Any`: `**attrs: Any`.

The `/` notation for positional-only parameters is only available in Python ≥ 3.8. In Python 3.7 or earlier, that’s a syntax error. The [PEP 484 convention](https://fpy.li/8-36) is to prefix each positional-only parameter name with two underscores. Here is the `tag` signature again, now in two lines, using the PEP 484 convention:

```
from
```

Mypy understands and enforces both ways of declaring positional-only parameters.

To close this chapter, let’s briefly consider the limits of type hints and the static type system they support.
