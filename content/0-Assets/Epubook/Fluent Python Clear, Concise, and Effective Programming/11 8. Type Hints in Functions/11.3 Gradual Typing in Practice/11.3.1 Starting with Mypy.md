## Starting with Mypy

To begin type checking, I run the `mypy` command on the _messages.py_ module:

…/no_hints/ $ pip install mypy
[lots of messages omitted...]
…/no_hints/ $ mypy messages.py
Success: no issues found in 1 source file

Mypy with default settings finds no problem with [Example 8-1](#msgs_no_hints).

###### Warning

I am using Mypy 0.910, the most recent release as I review this in July 2021. The Mypy [“Introduction”](https://fpy.li/8-7) warns that it “is officially beta software. There will be occasional changes that break backward compatibility.” Mypy is giving me at least one report that is not the same I got when I wrote this chapter in April 2020. By the time you read this, you may get different results than shown here.

If a function signature has no annotations, Mypy ignores it by default—unless configured otherwise.

For [Example 8-2](#msgs_test_no_hints), I also have `pytest` unit tests. This is the code in _messages_test.py_.

Now let’s add type hints, guided by Mypy.
