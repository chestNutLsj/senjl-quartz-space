# Gradual Typing in Practice

Let’s see how gradual typing works in practice, starting with a simple function and gradually adding type hints to it, guided by Mypy.

###### Note

There are several Python type checkers compatible with PEP 484, including Google’s [pytype](https://fpy.li/8-4), Microsoft’s [Pyright](https://fpy.li/8-5), Facebook’s [Pyre](https://fpy.li/8-6)—in addition to type checkers embedded in IDEs such as PyCharm. I picked [Mypy](https://fpy.li/mypy) for the examples because it’s the best known. However, one of the others may be a better fit for some projects or teams. Pytype, for example, is designed to handle codebases with no type hints and still provide useful advice. It is more lenient than Mypy, and can also generate annotations for your code.

We will annotate a `show_count` function that returns a string with a count and a singular or plural word, depending on the count:

```
>>> 
```

[Example 8-1](#msgs_no_hints) shows the source code of `show_count`, without annotations.

##### Example 8-1. `show_count` from _messages.py_ without type hints

```
