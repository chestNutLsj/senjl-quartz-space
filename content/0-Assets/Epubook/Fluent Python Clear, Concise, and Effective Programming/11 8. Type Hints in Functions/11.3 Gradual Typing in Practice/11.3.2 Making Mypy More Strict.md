## Making Mypy More Strict

The command-line option `--disallow-untyped-defs` makes Mypy flag any function definition that does not have type hints for all its parameters and for its return value.

Using `--disallow-untyped-defs` on the test file produces three errors and a note:

…/no_hints/ $ mypy --disallow-untyped-defs messages_test.py
messages.py:14: error: Function is missing a type annotation
messages_test.py:10: error: Function is missing a type annotation
messages_test.py:15: error: Function is missing a return type annotation
messages_test.py:15: note: Use "-> None" if function does not return a value
Found 3 errors in 2 files (checked 1 source file)

For the first steps with gradual typing, I prefer to use another option: `--disallow-incomplete-defs`. Initially, it tells me nothing:

…/no_hints/ $ mypy --disallow-incomplete-defs messages_test.py
Success: no issues found in 1 source file

Now I can add just the return type to `show_count` in _messages.py_:

def show_count(count, word) -> str:

This is enough to make Mypy look at it. Using the same command line as before to check _messages_test.py_ will lead Mypy to look at _messages.py_ again:

…/no_hints/ $ mypy --disallow-incomplete-defs messages_test.py
messages.py:14: error: Function is missing a type annotation
for one or more arguments
Found 1 error in 1 file (checked 1 source file)

Now I can gradually add type hints function by function, without getting warnings about functions that I haven’t annotated. This is a fully annotated signature that satisfies Mypy:

```
def
```

###### Tip

Instead of typing command-line options like `--disallow-incomplete-defs`, you can save your favorite as described in the [Mypy configuration file](https://fpy.li/8-8) documentation. You can have global settings and per-module settings. Here is a simple _mypy.ini_ to get started:

[mypy]
python_version = 3.9
warn_unused_configs = True
disallow_incomplete_defs = True
