## ABCs Are Mixins Too

In the Python standard library, the most visible use of multiple inheritance is the `collections.abc` package. That is not controversial: after all, even Java supports multiple inheritance of interfaces, and ABCs are interface declarations that may optionally provide concrete method implementations.[^9]

Pythonâ€™s official documentation of [`collections.abc`](https://fpy.li/14-13) uses the term _mixin method_ for the concrete methods implemented in many of the collection ABCs. The ABCs that provide mixin methods play two roles: they are interface definitions and also mixin classes. For example, the [implementation of `collections.UserDict`](https://fpy.li/14-14) relies on several of the mixin methods provided by `collections.abc.MutableMapping`.
