## ThreadingMixIn and ForkingMixIn

The [_http.server_](https://fpy.li/14-15) package provides `HTTPServer` and `ThreadingHTTPServer` classes. The latter was added in Python 3.7. Its documentation says:

class `http.server.ThreadingHTTPServer`(server_address, RequestHandlerClass)

This class is identical to `HTTPServer` but uses threads to handle requests by using the `ThreadingMixIn`. This is useful to handle web browsers pre-opening sockets, on which `HTTPServer` would wait indefinitely.

This is the [complete source code](https://fpy.li/14-16) for the `ThreadingHTTPServer` class in Python 3.10:

```

```

The [source code](https://fpy.li/14-17) of `socketserver.ThreadingMixIn` has 38 lines, including comments and docstrings. [ExampleÂ 14-10](#ex_threadmixin) shows a summary of its implementation.

`process_request_thread` does not call `super()` because it is a new method, not an override. Its implementation calls three instance methods that `HTTPServer` provides or inherits.

[![^2]

This overrides the `process_request` method that `HTTPServer` inherits from `socketserver.BaseServer`, starting a thread and delegating the actual work to `process_request_thread` running in that thread. It does not call `super()`.

[![^3]

`server_close` calls `super().server_close()` to stop taking requests, then waits for the threads started by `process_request` to finish their jobs.

The `ThreadingMixIn` appears in the [`socketserver`](https://fpy.li/14-18) module documentation next to `ForkingMixin`. The latter is designed to support concurrent servers based on [`os.fork()`](https://fpy.li/14-19), an API for launching a child process, available in [POSIX](https://fpy.li/14-20)-compliant Unix-like systems.
