## Favor Object Composition over Class Inheritance

The title of this subsection is the second principle of object-oriented design from the _Design Patterns_ book,[^12] and is the best advice I can offer here. Once you get comfortable with inheritance, it’s too easy to overuse it. Placing objects in a neat hierarchy appeals to our sense of order; programmers do it just for fun.

Favoring composition leads to more flexible designs. For example, in the case of the `tkinter.Widget` class, instead of inheriting the methods from all geometry managers, widget instances could hold a reference to a geometry manager, and invoke its methods. After all, a `Widget` should not “be” a geometry manager, but could use the services of one via delegation. Then you could add a new geometry manager without touching the widget class hierarchy and without worrying about name clashes. Even with single inheritance, this principle enhances flexibility, because subclassing is a form of tight coupling, and tall inheritance trees tend to be brittle.

Composition and delegation can replace the use of mixins to make behaviors available to different classes, but cannot replace the use of interface inheritance to define a hierarchy of types.
