## Provide Aggregate Classes to Users

If some combination of ABCs or mixins is particularly useful to client code, provide a class that brings them together in a sensible way.

For example, here is the complete [source code](https://fpy.li/14-29) for the Django `ListView` class on the bottom right of [Figure 14-4](#django_view_list_uml):

```
class
```

The body of `ListView` is empty, but the class provides a useful service: it brings together a mixin and a base class that should be used together.

Another example is [`tkinter.Widget`](https://fpy.li/14-30), which has four base classes and no methods or attributes of its own—just a docstring. Thanks to the `Widget` aggregate class, we can create new a widget with the required mixins, without having to figure out in which order they should be declared to work as intended.

Note that aggregate classes don’t have to be completely empty, but they often are.
