## Special Attributes that Affect Attribute Handling

The behavior of many of the functions and special methods listed in the following sections depend on three special attributes:

`__class__`

A reference to the object’s class (i.e., `obj.__class__` is the same as `type(obj)`). Python looks for special methods such as `__getattr__` only in an object’s class, and not in the instances themselves.

`__dict__`

A mapping that stores the writable attributes of an object or class. An object that has a `__dict__` can have arbitrary new attributes set at any time. If a class has a `__slots__` attribute, then its instances may not have a `__dict__`. See `__slots__` (next).

`__slots__`

An attribute that may be defined in a class to save memory. `__slots__` is a `tuple` of strings naming the allowed attributes.[^13] for more.
