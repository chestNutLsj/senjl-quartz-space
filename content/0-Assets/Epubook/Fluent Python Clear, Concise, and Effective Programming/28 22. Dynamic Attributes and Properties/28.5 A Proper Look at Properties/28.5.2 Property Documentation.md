## Property Documentation

When tools such as the console `help()` function or IDEs need to display the documentation of a property, they extract the information from the `__doc__` attribute of the property.

If used with the classic call syntax, `property` can get the documentation string as the `doc` argument:

    `weight` `=` `property``(``get_weight``,` `set_weight``,` `doc``=``'weight in kilograms'``)`

The docstring of the getter method—the one with the `@property` decorator itself—is used as the documentation of the property as a whole. [Figure 22-1](#help_foo_screens) shows the help screens generated from the code in [Example 22-26](#ex_foo_property_doc).

Now that we have these property essentials covered, let’s go back to the issue of protecting both the `weight` and `price` attributes of `LineItem` so they only accept values greater than zero—but without implementing two nearly identical pairs of getters/setters by hand.
