# Computed Properties

We first saw the `@property` decorator in [Chapter 11](ch11.html#pythonic_objects), in the section, [“A Hashable Vector2d”](ch11.html#hashable_vector2d). In [Example 11-7](ch11.html#ex_vector2d_v3), I used two properties in `Vector2d` just to make the `x` and `y` attributes read-only. Here we will see properties that compute values, leading to a discussion of how to cache such values.

The records in the `'events'` list of the OSCON JSON data contain integer serial numbers pointing to records in the `'speakers'` and `'venues'` lists. For example, this is the record for a conference talk (with an elided description):

```
{
```

````` ```` ``   We will implement an `Event` class with `venue` and `speakers` properties to return the linked data automatically—in other words, “dereferencing” the serial number. Given an `Event` instance, [Example 22-7](#ex22-7-added-uuid) shows the desired behavior.  ##### Example 22-7. Reading `venue` and `speakers` returns `Record` objects  ```     >>> event   ```  [![^1]  The `event.speakers` property returns a list of `Record` instances.  As usual, we will build the code step-by-step, starting with the `Record` class and a function to read the JSON data and return a `dict` with `Record` instances.   `` ```` `````
