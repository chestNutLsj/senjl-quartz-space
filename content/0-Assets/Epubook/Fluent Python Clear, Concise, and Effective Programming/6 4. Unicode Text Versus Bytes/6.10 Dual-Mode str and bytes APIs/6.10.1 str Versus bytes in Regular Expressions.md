## str Versus bytes in Regular Expressions

If you build a regular expression with `bytes`, patterns such as `\d` and `\w` only match ASCII characters; in contrast, if these patterns are given as `str`, they match Unicode digits or letters beyond ASCII. [Example 4-23](#ex_re_demo) and [Figure 4-8](#fig_re_demo) compare how letters, ASCII digits, superscripts, and Tamil digits are matched by `str` and `bytes` patterns.

##### Example 4-23. ramanujan.py: compare behavior of simple `str` and `bytes` regular expressions

```
import
```

[![^1]

The first two regular expressions are of the `str` type.

[![^2]

The last two are of the `bytes` type.

[![^3]

Unicode text to search, containing the Tamil digits for `1729` (the logical line continues until the right parenthesis token).

[![^4]

This string is joined to the previous one at compile time (see [“2.4.2. String literal concatenation”](https://fpy.li/4-26) in _The Python Language Reference_).

[![^5]

A `bytes` string is needed to search with the `bytes` regular expressions.

[![^6]

The `str` pattern `r'\d+'` matches the Tamil and ASCII digits.

[![^7]

The `bytes` pattern `rb'\d+'` matches only the ASCII bytes for digits.

[![^8]

The `str` pattern `r'\w+'` matches the letters, superscripts, Tamil, and ASCII digits.

[![^9]

The `bytes` pattern `rb'\w+'` matches only the ASCII bytes for letters and digits.

###### Figure 4-8. Screenshot of running ramanujan.py from [Example 4-23](#ex_re_demo).

[Example 4-23](#ex_re_demo) is a trivial example to make one point: you can use regular expressions on `str` and `bytes`, but in the second case, bytes outside the ASCII range are treated as nondigits and nonword characters.

For `str` regular expressions, there is a `re.ASCII` flag that makes `\w`, `\W`, `\b`, `\B`, `\d`, `\D`, `\s`, and `\S` perform ASCII-only matching. See the [documentation of the `re` module](https://fpy.li/4-27) for full details.

Another important dual-mode module is `os`.
