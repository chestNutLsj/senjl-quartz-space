# Understanding Encode/Decode Problems

Although there is a generic `UnicodeError` exception, the error reported by Python is usually more specific: either a `UnicodeEncodeError` (when converting `str` to binary sequences) or a `UnicodeDecodeError` (when reading binary sequences into `str`). Loading Python modules may also raise `SyntaxError` when the source encoding is unexpected. Weâ€™ll show how to handle all of these errors in the next sections.

###### Tip

The first thing to note when you get a Unicode error is the exact type of the exception. Is it a `UnicodeEncodeError`, a `UnicodeDecodeError`, or some other error (e.g., `SyntaxError`) that mentions an encoding problem? To solve the problem, you have to understand it first.
