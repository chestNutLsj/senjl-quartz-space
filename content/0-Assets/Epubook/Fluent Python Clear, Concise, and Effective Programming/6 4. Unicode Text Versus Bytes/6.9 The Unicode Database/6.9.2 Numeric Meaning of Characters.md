## Numeric Meaning of Characters

The `unicodedata` module includes functions to check whether a Unicode character represents a number and, if so, its numeric value for humans—as opposed to its code point number. [Example 4-22](#ex_numerics_demo) shows the use of `unicodedata.name()` and `unicodedata.numeric()`, along with the `.isdecimal()` and `.isnumeric()` methods of `str`.

##### Example 4-22. Demo of Unicode database numerical character metadata (callouts describe each column in the output)

```
import
```

[![^1]

Code point in `U+0000` format.

[![^2]

Character centralized in a `str` of length 6.

[![^3]

Show `re_dig` if character matches the `r'\d'` regex.

[![^4]

Show `isdig` if `char.isdigit()` is `True`.

[![^5]

Show `isnum` if `char.isnumeric()` is `True`.

[![^6]

Numeric value formatted with width 5 and 2 decimal places.

[![^7]

Unicode character name.

Running [Example 4-22](#ex_numerics_demo) gives you [Figure 4-7](#numerics_demo_fig), if your terminal font has all those glyphs.

The sixth column of [Figure 4-7](#numerics_demo_fig) is the result of calling `unicodedata.numeric(char)` on the character. It shows that Unicode knows the numeric value of symbols that represent numbers. So if you want to create a spreadsheet application that supports Tamil digits or Roman numerals, go for it!

[Figure 4-7](#numerics_demo_fig) shows that the regular expression `r'\d'` matches the digit “1” and the Devanagari digit 3, but not some other characters that are considered digits by the `isdigit` function. The `re` module is not as savvy about Unicode as it could be. The new `regex` module available on PyPI was designed to eventually replace `re` and provides better Unicode support.[^11] We’ll come back to the `re` module in the next section.

Throughout this chapter we’ve used several `unicodedata` functions, but there are many more we did not cover. See the standard library documentation for the [`unicodedata` module](https://fpy.li/4-25).

Next we’ll take a quick look at dual-mode APIs offering functions that accept `str` or `bytes` arguments with special handling depending on the type.
