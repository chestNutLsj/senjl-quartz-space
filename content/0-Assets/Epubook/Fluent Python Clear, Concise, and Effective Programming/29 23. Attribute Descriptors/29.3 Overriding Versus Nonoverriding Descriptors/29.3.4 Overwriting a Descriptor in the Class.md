## Overwriting a Descriptor in the Class

Regardless of whether a descriptor is overriding or not, it can be overwritten by assignment to the class. This is a monkey-patching technique, but in [Example 23-12](#descriptorkinds_demo4) the descriptors are replaced by integers, which would effectively break any class that depended on the descriptors for proper operation.

##### Example 23-12. Any descriptor can be overwritten on the class itself

```

```

[![^1]

Create a new instance for later testing.

[![^2]

Overwrite the descriptor attributes in the class.

[![^3]

The descriptors are really gone.

[Example 23-12](#descriptorkinds_demo4) reveals another asymmetry regarding reading and writing attributes: although the reading of a class attribute can be controlled by a descriptor with `__get__` attached to the managed class, the writing of a class attribute cannot be handled by a descriptor with `__set__` attached to the same class.

###### Tip

In order to control the setting of attributes in a class, you have to attach descriptors to the class of the class—in other words, the metaclass. By default, the metaclass of user-defined classes is `type`, and you cannot add attributes to `type`. But in [Chapter 24](ch24.html#class_metaprog), we’ll create our own metaclasses.

Let’s now focus on how descriptors are used to implement methods in Python.
