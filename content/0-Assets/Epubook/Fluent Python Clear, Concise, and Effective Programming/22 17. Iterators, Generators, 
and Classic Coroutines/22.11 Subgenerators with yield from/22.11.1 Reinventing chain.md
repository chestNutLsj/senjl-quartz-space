## Reinventing chain

We saw in [Table 17-3](#merging_genfunc_tbl) that `itertools` provides a `chain` generator that yields items from several iterables, iterating over the first, then the second, and so on up to the last. This is a homemade implementation of `chain` with nested `for` loops in Python:[^10]

```
>>> 
```

The `chain` generator in the preceding code is delegating to each iterable `it` in turn, by driving each `it` in the inner `for` loop. That inner loop can be replaced with a `yield from` expression, as shown in the next console listing:

```
>>> 
```

The use of `yield from` in this example is correct, and the code reads better, but it seems like syntactic sugar with little real gain. Now let’s develop a more interesting example.
