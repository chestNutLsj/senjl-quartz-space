# What’s New in This Chapter

[“Subgenerators with yield from”](#yield_from_sec0) grew from one to six pages. It now includes simpler experiments demonstrating the behavior of generators with `yield from`, and an example of traversing a tree data structure, developed step-by-step.

New sections explain the type hints for `Iterable`, `Iterator`, and `Generator` types.

The last major section of this chapter, [“Classic Coroutines”](#classic_coroutines_sec), is a 9-page introduction to a topic that filled a 40-page chapter in the first edition. I updated and moved the [“Classic Coroutines”](https://fpy.li/oldcoro) chapter to a [post in the companion website](https://fpy.li/oldcoro) because it was the most challenging chapter for readers, but its subject matter is less relevant after Python 3.5 introduced native coroutines—which we’ll study in [Chapter 21](ch21.html#async_ch).

We’ll get started studying how the `iter()` built-in function makes sequences iterable.
