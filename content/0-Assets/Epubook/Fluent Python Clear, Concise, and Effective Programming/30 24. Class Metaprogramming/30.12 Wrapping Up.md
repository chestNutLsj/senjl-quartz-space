# Wrapping Up

Metaclasses, as well as class decorators and `__init_subclass__` are useful for:

- Subclass registration
    
- Subclass structural validation
    
- Applying decorators to many methods at once
    
- Object serialization
    
- Object-relational mapping
    
- Object-based persistence
    
- Implementing special methods at the class level
    - Implementing class features found in other languages, such as [traits](https://fpy.li/24-17) and [aspect-oriented programming](https://fpy.li/24-18)
    

Class metaprogramming can also help with performance issues in some cases, by performing tasks at import time that otherwise would execute repeatedly at runtime.

To wrap up, let’s recall Alex Martelli’s final advice from his essay [“Waterfowl and ABCs”](ch13.html#waterfowl_essay):

> And, _don’t_ define custom ABCs (or metaclasses) in production code… if you feel the urge to do so, I’d bet it’s likely to be a case of “all problems look like a nail”-syndrome for somebody who just got a shiny new hammer—you (and future maintainers of your code) will be much happier sticking with straightforward and simple code, eschewing such depths.

I believe Martelli’s advice applies not only to ABCs and metaclasses, but also to class hierarchies, operator overloading, function decorators, descriptors, class decorators, and class builders using `__init_subclass__`.

Those powerful tools exist primarily to support library and framework development. Applications naturally should _use_ those tools, as provided by the Python standard library or external packages. But _implementing_ them in application code is often premature abstraction.
