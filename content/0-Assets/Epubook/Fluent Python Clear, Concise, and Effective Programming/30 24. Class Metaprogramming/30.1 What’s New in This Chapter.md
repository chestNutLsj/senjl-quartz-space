# What’s New in This Chapter

All the code in the “Class Metaprogramming” chapter of the first edition of _Fluent Python_ still runs correctly. However, some of the previous examples no longer represent the simplest solutions in light of new features added since Python 3.6.

I replaced those examples with different ones, highlighting Python’s new metaprogramming features or adding further requirements to justify the use of the more advanced techniques. Some of the new examples leverage type hints to provide class builders similar to the `@dataclass` decorator and `typing.NamedTuple`.

[“Metaclasses in the Real World”](#metaclases_real_world_sec) is a new section with some high-level considerations about the applicability of metaclasses.

###### Tip

Some of the best refactorings are removing code made redundant by newer and simpler ways of solving the same problems. This applies to production code as well as books.

We’ll get started by reviewing attributes and methods defined in the Python Data Model for all classes.
