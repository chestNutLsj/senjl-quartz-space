## Metaclasses Should Be Implementation Details

Besides `type`, there are only six metaclasses in the entire Python 3.9 standard library. The better known metaclasses are probably `abc.ABCMeta`, `typing.NamedTupleMeta`, and `enum.EnumMeta`. None of them are intended to appear explicitly in user code. We may consider them implementation details.

Although you can do some really wacky metaprogramming with metaclasses, it’s best to heed the [principle of least astonishment](https://fpy.li/24-15) so that most users can indeed regard metaclasses as implementation details.[^17]

In recent years, some metaclasses in the Python standard library were replaced by other mechanisms, without breaking the public API of their packages. The simplest way to future-proof such APIs is to offer a regular class that users subclass to access the functionality provided by the metaclass, as we’ve done in our examples.

To wrap up our coverage of class metaprogramming, I will share with you the coolest, small example of metaclass I found as I researched this chapter.
