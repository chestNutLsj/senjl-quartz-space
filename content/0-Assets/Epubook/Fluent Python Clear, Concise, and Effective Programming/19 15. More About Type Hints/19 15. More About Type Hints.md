# Chapter 15. More About Type Hints

> I learned a painful lesson that for small programs, dynamic typing is great. For large programs you need a more disciplined approach. And it helps if the language gives you that discipline rather than telling you “Well, you can do whatever you want”.

This chapter is a sequel to [Chapter 8](ch08.html#type_hints_in_def_ch), covering more of Python’s gradual type system. The main topics are:

- Overloaded function signatures
    
- `typing.TypedDict` for type hinting `dicts` used as records
    
- Type casting
    
- Runtime access to type hints
    
- Generic types
    
    - Declaring a generic class
        
    - Variance: invariant, covariant, and contravariant types
        
    - Generic static protocols
