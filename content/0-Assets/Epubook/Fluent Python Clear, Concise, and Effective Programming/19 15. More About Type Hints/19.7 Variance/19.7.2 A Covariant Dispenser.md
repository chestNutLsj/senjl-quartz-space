## A Covariant Dispenser

If we want to be more flexible and model dispensers as a generic class that can accept some beverage type and also its subtypes, we must make it covariant. [Example 15-19](#covariant_dispenser_types_ex) shows how we’d declare `BeverageDispenser`.

##### Example 15-19. _covariant.py_: type definitions and `install` function

```
T_co
```

[![^1]

Set `covariant=True` when declaring the type variable; `_co` is a conventional suffix for covariant type parameters on _typeshed_.

[![^2]

Use `T_co` to parameterize the `Generic` special class.

[![^3]

Type hints for `install` are the same as in [Example 15-18](#invariant_dispenser_types_ex).

The following code works because now both the `Juice` dispenser and the `OrangeJuice` dispenser are valid in a covariant `BeverageDispenser`:

```
juice_dispenser
```

But a dispenser for an arbitrary `Beverage` is not acceptable:

```
beverage_dispenser
```

That’s covariance: the subtype relationship of the parameterized dispensers varies in the same direction as the subtype relationship of the type parameters.
