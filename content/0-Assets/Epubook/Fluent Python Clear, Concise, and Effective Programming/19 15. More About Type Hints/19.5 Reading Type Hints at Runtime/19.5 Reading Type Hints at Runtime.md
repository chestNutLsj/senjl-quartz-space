# Reading Type Hints at Runtime

At import time, Python reads the type hints in functions, classes, and modules, and stores them in attributes named `__annotations__`. For instance, consider the `clip` function in [Example 15-14](#ex_clip_annot).[^12]

##### Example 15-14. clipannot.py: annotated signature of a `clip` function

```
def
```

The type hints are stored as a `dict` in the `__annotations__` attribute of the function:

```
>>> 
```

The `'return'` key maps to the return type hint after the `->` symbol in [Example 15-14](#ex_clip_annot).

Note that the annotations are evaluated by the interpreter at import time, just as parameter default values are also evaluated. That’s why the values in the annotations are the Python classes `str` and `int`, and not the strings `'str'` and `'int'`. The import time evaluation of annotations is the standard as of Python 3.10, but that may change if [PEP 563](https://fpy.li/pep563) or [PEP 649](https://fpy.li/pep649) become the standard behavior.
