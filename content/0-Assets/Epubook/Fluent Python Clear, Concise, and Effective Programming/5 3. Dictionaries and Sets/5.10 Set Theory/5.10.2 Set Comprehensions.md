## Set Comprehensions

Set comprehensions (_setcomps_) were added way back in Python 2.7, together with the dictcomps that we saw in [“dict Comprehensions”](#dictcomp_sec). [Example 3-15](#ex_setcomp) shows how.

##### Example 3-15. Build a set of Latin-1 characters that have the word “SIGN” in their Unicode names

```
>>> 
```

[![^1]

Import `name` function from `unicodedata` to obtain character names.

[![^2]

Build set of characters with codes from 32 to 255 that have the word `'SIGN'` in their names.

The order of the output changes for each Python process, because of the salted hash mentioned in [“What Is Hashable”](#what_is_hashable).

Syntax matters aside, let’s now consider the behavior of sets.
