# Practical Consequences of How Sets Work

The `set` and `frozenset` types are both implemented with a hash table. This has these effects:

- Set elements must be hashable objects. They must implement proper `__hash__` and `__eq__` methods as described in [“What Is Hashable”](#what_is_hashable).
    
- Membership testing is very efficient. A set may have millions of elements, but an element can be located directly by computing its hash code and deriving an index offset, with the possible overhead of a small number of tries to find a matching element or exhaust the search.
    
- Sets have a significant memory overhead, compared to a low-level array pointers to its elements—which would be more compact but also much slower to search beyond a handful of elements.
    
- Element ordering depends on insertion order, but not in a useful or reliable way. If two elements are different but have the same hash code, their position depends on which element is added first.
    
- Adding elements to a set may change the order of existing elements. That’s because the algorithm becomes less efficient if the hash table is more than two-thirds full, so Python may need to move and resize the table as it grows. When this happens, elements are reinserted and their relative ordering may change.

Let’s now review the rich assortment of operations provided by sets.
