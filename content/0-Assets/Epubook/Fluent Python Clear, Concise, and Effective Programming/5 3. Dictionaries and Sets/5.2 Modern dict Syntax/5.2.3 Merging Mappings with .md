## Merging Mappings with |

Python 3.9 supports using `|` and `|=` to merge mappings. This makes sense, since these are also the set union operators.

The `|` operator creates a new mapping:

```
>>> 
```

Usually the type of the new mapping will be the same as the type of the left operand—`d1` in the example—but it can be the type of the second operand if user-defined types are involved, according to the operator overloading rules we explore in [Chapter 16](ch16.html#operator_overloading).

To update an existing mapping in place, use `|=`. Continuing from the previous example, `d1` was not changed, but now it is:

```
>>> 
```

###### Tip

If you need to maintain code to run on Python 3.8 or earlier, the [“Motivation”](https://fpy.li/3-1) section of [PEP 584—Add Union Operators To dict](https://fpy.li/pep584) provides a good summary of other ways to merge mappings.

Now let’s see how pattern matching applies to mappings.
