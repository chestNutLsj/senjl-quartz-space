## Unpacking Mappings

[PEP 448—Additional Unpacking Generalizations](https://fpy.li/pep448) enhanced the support of mapping unpackings in two ways, since Python 3.5.

First, we can apply `**` to more than one argument in a function call. This works when keys are all strings and unique across all arguments (because duplicate keyword arguments are forbidden):

```
>>> 
```

Second, `**` can be used inside a `dict` literal—also multiple times:

```
>>> 
```

In this case, duplicate keys are allowed. Later occurrences overwrite previous ones—see the value mapped to `x` in the example.

This syntax can also be used to merge mappings, but there are other ways. Please read on.
