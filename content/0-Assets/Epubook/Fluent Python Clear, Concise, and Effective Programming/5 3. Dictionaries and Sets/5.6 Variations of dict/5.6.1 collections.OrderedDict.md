## collections.OrderedDict

Now that the built-in `dict` also keeps the keys ordered since Python 3.6, the most common reason to use `OrderedDict` is writing code that is backward compatible with earlier Python versions. Having said that, Python’s documentation lists some remaining differences between `dict` and `OrderedDict`, which I quote here—only reordering the items for relevance in daily use:

- The equality operation for `OrderedDict` checks for matching order.
    
- The `popitem()` method of `OrderedDict` has a different signature. It accepts an optional argument to specify which item is popped.
    
- `OrderedDict` has a `move_to_end()` method to efficiently reposition an element to an endpoint.
    
- The regular `dict` was designed to be very good at mapping operations. Tracking insertion order was secondary.
    
- `OrderedDict` was designed to be good at reordering operations. Space efficiency, iteration speed, and the performance of update operations were secondary.
    
- Algorithmically, `OrderedDict` can handle frequent reordering operations better than `dict`. This makes it suitable for tracking recent accesses (for example, in an LRU cache).
