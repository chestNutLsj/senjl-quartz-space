## Emulating Numeric Types

Several special methods allow user objects to respond to operators such as `+`. We will cover that in more detail in [Chapter 16](ch16.html#operator_overloading), but here our goal is to further illustrate the use of special methods through another simple example.

We will implement a class to represent two-dimensional vectors—that is, Euclidean vectors like those used in math and physics (see [Figure 1-1](#vectors_fig)).

###### Tip

The built-in `complex` type can be used to represent two-dimensional vectors, but our class can be extended to represent _n_-dimensional vectors. We will do that in [Chapter 17](ch17.html#iterables2generators).

###### Figure 1-1. Example of two-dimensional vector addition; Vector(2, 4) + Vector(2, 1) results in Vector(4, 5).

We will start designing the API for such a class by writing a simulated console session that we can use later as a doctest. The following snippet tests the vector addition pictured in [Figure 1-1](#vectors_fig):

```
>>> 
```

Note how the `+` operator results in a new `Vector`, displayed in a friendly format at the console.

The `abs` built-in function returns the absolute value of integers and floats, and the magnitude of `complex` numbers, so to be consistent, our API also uses `abs` to calculate the magnitude of a vector:

```
>>> 
```

We can also implement the `*` operator to perform scalar multiplication (i.e., multiplying a vector by a number to make a new vector with the same direction and a multiplied magnitude):

```
>>> 
```

[Example 1-2](#ex_vector2d) is a `Vector` class implementing the operations just described, through the use of the special methods `__repr__`, `__abs__`, `__add__`, and `__mul__`.

##### Example 1-2. A simple two-dimensional vector class

```
"""
```

We implemented five special methods in addition to the familiar `__init__`. Note that none of them is directly called within the class or in the typical usage of the class illustrated by the doctests. As mentioned before, the Python interpreter is the only frequent caller of most special methods.

[Example 1-2](#ex_vector2d) implements two operators: `+` and `*`, to show basic usage of `__add__` and `__mul__`. In both cases, the methods create and return a new instance of `Vector`, and do not modify either operand—`self` or `other` are merely read. This is the expected behavior of infix operators: to create new objects and not touch their operands. I will have a lot more to say about that in [Chapter 16](ch16.html#operator_overloading).

###### Warning

As implemented, [Example 1-2](#ex_vector2d) allows multiplying a `Vector` by a number, but not a number by a `Vector`, which violates the commutative property of scalar multiplication. We will fix that with the special method `__rmul__` in [Chapter 16](ch16.html#operator_overloading).

In the following sections, we discuss the other special methods in `Vector`.
