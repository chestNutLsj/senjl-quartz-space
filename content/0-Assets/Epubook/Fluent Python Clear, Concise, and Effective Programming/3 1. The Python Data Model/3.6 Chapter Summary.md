# Chapter Summary

By implementing special methods, your objects can behave like the built-in types, enabling the expressive coding style the community considers Pythonic.

A basic requirement for a Python object is to provide usable string representations of itself, one used for debugging and logging, another for presentation to end users. That is why the special methods `__repr__` and `__str__` exist in the data model.

Emulating sequences, as shown with the `FrenchDeck` example, is one of the most common uses of the special methods. For example, database libraries often return query results wrapped in sequence-like collections. Making the most of existing sequence types is the subject of [Chapter 2](ch02.html#sequences). Implementing your own sequences will be covered in [Chapter 12](ch12.html#user_defined_sequences), when we create a multidimensional extension of the `Vector` class.

Thanks to operator overloading, Python offers a rich selection of numeric types, from the built-ins to `decimal.Decimal` and `fractions.Fraction`, all supporting infix arithmetic operators. The _NumPy_ data science libraries support infix operators with matrices and tensors. Implementing operators—including reversed operators and augmented assignment—will be shown in [Chapter 16](ch16.html#operator_overloading) via enhancements of the `Vector` example.

The use and implementation of the majority of the remaining special methods of the Python Data Model are covered throughout this book.
