### Asynchronous generators versus native coroutines

Here are some key similarities and differences between a native coroutine and an asynchronous generator function:

- Both are declared with `async def`.
    
- An asynchronous generator always has a `yield` expression in its body—that’s what makes it a generator. A native coroutine never contains `yield`.
    
- A native coroutine may `return` some value other than `None`. An asynchronous generator can only use empty `return` statements.
    
- Native coroutines are awaitable: they can be driven by `await` expressions or passed to one of the many `asyncio` functions that take awaitable arguments, such as `create_task`. Asynchronous generators are not awaitable. They are asynchronous iterables, driven by `async for` or by asynchronous comprehensions.
    

Time to talk about asynchronous comprehensions.
