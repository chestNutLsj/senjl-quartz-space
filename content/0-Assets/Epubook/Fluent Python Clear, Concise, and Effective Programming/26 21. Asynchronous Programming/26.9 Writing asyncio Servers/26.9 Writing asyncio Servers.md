# Writing asyncio Servers

The classic toy example of a TCP server is an [echo server](https://fpy.li/21-25). We’ll build slightly more interesting toys: server-side Unicode character search utilities, first using HTTP with _FastAPI_, then using plain TCP with `asyncio` only.

These servers let users query for Unicode characters based on words in their standard names from the `unicodedata` module we discussed in [“The Unicode Database”](ch04.html#unicodedata_sec). [Figure 21-2](#web_mojifinder_result) shows a session with _web_mojifinder.py_, the first server we’ll build.

The Unicode search logic in these examples is in the `InvertedIndex` class in the _charindex.py_ module in the [_Fluent Python_ code repository](https://fpy.li/code). There’s nothing concurrent in that small module, so I’ll only give a brief overview in the optional box that follows. You can skip to the HTTP server implementation in [“A FastAPI Web Service”](#fastapi_web_service_sec).

##### Meet the Inverted Index

An inverted index usually maps words to documents in which they occur. In the _mojifinder_ examples, each “document” is one Unicode character. The `charindex.InvertedIndex` class indexes each word that appears in each character name in the Unicode database, and creates an inverted index stored in a `defaultdict`. For example, to index character U+0037—DIGIT SEVEN—the `InvertedIndex` initializer appends the character `'7'` to the entries under the keys `'DIGIT'` and `'SEVEN'`. After indexing the Unicode 13.0.0 data bundled with Python 3.9.1, `'DIGIT'` maps to 868 characters, and `'SEVEN'` maps to 143, including U+1F556—CLOCK FACE SEVEN OCLOCK and U+2790—DINGBAT NEGATIVE CIRCLED SANS-SERIF DIGIT SEVEN (which appears in many code listings in this book).

See [Figure 21-3](#inverted_index_fig) for a demonstration using the entries for `'CAT'` and `'FACE'`.[^9]

###### Figure 21-3. Python console exploring `InvertedIndex` attribute `entries` and `search` method.

The `InvertedIndex.search` method breaks the query into words, and returns the intersection of the entries for each word. That’s why searching for “face” finds 171 results, “cat” finds 14, but “cat face” only 10.

That’s the beautiful idea behind an inverted index: a fundamental building block in information retrieval—the theory behind search engines. See the English Wikipedia article [“Inverted Index”](https://fpy.li/21-27) to learn more.
