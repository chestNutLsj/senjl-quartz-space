# Chapter Summary

This chapter started with context managers and the meaning of the `with` statement, quickly moving beyond its common use to automatically close opened files. We implemented a custom context manager: the `LookingGlass` class with the `__enter__/__exit__` methods, and saw how to handle exceptions in the `__exit__` method. A key point that Raymond Hettinger made in his PyCon US 2013 keynote is that `with` is not just for resource management; it’s a tool for factoring out common setup and teardown code, or any pair of operations that need to be done before and after another procedure.[^14]

We reviewed functions in the `contextlib` standard library module. One of them, the `@contextmanager` decorator, makes it possible to implement a context manager using a simple generator with one `yield`—a leaner solution than coding a class with at least two methods. We reimplemented the `LookingGlass` as a `looking_glass` generator function, and discussed how to do exception handling when using `@contextmanager`.

Then we studied Peter Norvig’s elegant _lis.py_, a Scheme interpreter written in idiomatic Python, refactored to use `match/case` in `evaluate`—the function at the core of any interpreter. Understanding how `evaluate` works required reviewing a little bit of Scheme, a parser for S-expressions, a simple REPL, and the construction of nested scopes through an `Environment` subclass of `collection.ChainMap`. In the end, _lis.py_ became a vehicle to explore much more than pattern matching. It shows how the different parts of an interpreter work together, illuminating core features of Python itself: why reserved keywords are necessary, how scoping rules work, and how closures are built and used.
