### Catch syntax errors

If the subject `exp` does not match any of the previous cases, the catch-all `case` raises a `SyntaxError`:

    `case` `_``:`
        `raise` `SyntaxError``(``lispstr``(``exp``))`

Here is an example of a malformed `(lambda …)` reported as a `SyntaxError`:

```
>>> 
```

If the `case` for function call did not have that guard rejecting keywords, the `(lambda is not like this)` expression would be handled as a function call, which would raise `KeyError` because `'lambda'` is not part of the environment—just like `lambda` is not a Python built-in function.
