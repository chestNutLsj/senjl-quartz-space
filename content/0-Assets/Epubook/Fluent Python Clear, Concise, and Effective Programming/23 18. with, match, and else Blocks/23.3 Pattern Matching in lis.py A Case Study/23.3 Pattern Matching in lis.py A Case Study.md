# Pattern Matching in lis.py: A Case Study

In [“Pattern Matching Sequences in an Interpreter”](ch02.html#pattern_matching_seq_interp_sec) we saw examples of sequence patterns extracted from the `evaluate` function of Peter Norvig’s _lis.py_ interpreter, ported to Python 3.10. In this section I want to give a broader overview of how _lis.py_ works, and also explore all the `case` clauses of `evaluate`, explaining not only the patterns but also what the interpreter does in each `case`.

Besides showing more pattern matching, I wrote this section for three reasons:

1. Norvig’s _lis.py_ is a beautiful example of idiomatic Python code.
    
2. The simplicity of Scheme is a master class of language design.
    
3. Learning how an interpreter works gave me a deeper understanding of Python and programming languages in general—interpreted or compiled.
    

Before looking at the Python code, let’s get a little taste of Scheme so you can make sense of this case study—in case you haven’t seen Scheme or Lisp before.
