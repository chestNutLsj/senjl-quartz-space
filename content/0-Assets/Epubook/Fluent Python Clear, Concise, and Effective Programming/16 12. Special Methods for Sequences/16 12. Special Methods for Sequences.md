# Chapter 12. Special Methods for Sequences

> Don’t check whether it _is_-a duck: check whether it _quacks_-like-a duck, _walks_-like-a duck, etc., etc., depending on exactly what subset of duck-like behavior you need to play your language-games with. (`comp.lang.python`, Jul. 26, 2000)

In this chapter, we will create a class to represent a multidimensional `Vector` class—a significant step up from the two-dimensional `Vector2d` of [Chapter 11](ch11.html#pythonic_objects). `Vector` will behave like a standard Python immutable flat sequence. Its elements will be floats, and it will support the following by the end of this chapter:

- Basic sequence protocol: `__len__` and `__getitem__`
    
- Safe representation of instances with many items
    
- Proper slicing support, producing new `Vector` instances
    
- Aggregate hashing, taking into account every contained element value
    
- Custom formatting language extension
    

We’ll also implement dynamic attribute access with `__getattr__` as a way of replacing the read-only properties we used in `Vector2d`—although this is not typical of sequence types.

The code-intensive presentation will be interrupted by a conceptual discussion about the idea of protocols as an informal interface. We’ll talk about how protocols and _duck typing_ are related, and its practical implications when you create your own types.
