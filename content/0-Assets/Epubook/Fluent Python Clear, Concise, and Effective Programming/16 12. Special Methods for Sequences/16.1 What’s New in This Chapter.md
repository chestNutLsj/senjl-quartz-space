# What’s New in This Chapter

There are no major changes in this chapter. There is a new, brief discussion of the `typing.Protocol` in a tip box near the end of [“Protocols and Duck Typing”](#protocol_duck_section).

In [“A Slice-Aware __getitem__”](#slice_aware_sec), the implementation of `__getitem__` in [Example 12-6](#ex_vector_v2) is more concise and robust than the example in the first edition, thanks to duck typing and `operator.index`. This change carried over to later implementations of `Vector` in this chapter and in [Chapter 16](ch16.html#operator_overloading).

Let’s get started.
