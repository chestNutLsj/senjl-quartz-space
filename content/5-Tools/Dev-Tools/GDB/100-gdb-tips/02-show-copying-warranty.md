                   GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE  
                      Version 3, 29 June 2007  
  
Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/>  
Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies  
of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.  
  
                           Preamble  
  
 The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for  
software and other kinds of works.  
  
 The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed  
to take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast,  
the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to  
share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free  
software for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the  
GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to  
any other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to  
your programs, too.  
  
 When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not  
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you  
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for  
them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you  
want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new  
free programs, and that you know you can do these things.  
--Type <RET> for more, q to quit, c to continue without paging--
```
