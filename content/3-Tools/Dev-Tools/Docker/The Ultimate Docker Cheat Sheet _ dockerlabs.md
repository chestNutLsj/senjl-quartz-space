A cheatsheet is a concise summary of important information that is meant to be used as a quick reference. Cheatsheets are often used in the form of a list or a table, and they typically cover a specific topic or subject area. In the context of Docker, a Docker cheatsheet is a summary of commonly used Docker commands and their options, as well as other useful information related to Docker.

Cheatsheets can be particularly helpful when learning a new tool or technology, as they provide a convenient way to quickly look up and remind oneself of key concepts and commands. They can also be useful for experienced users who need to recall a specific command or option but may not remember all the details.

## The Docker CLI

## Manage images

### `docker build`

```
docker build [options] .
  -t "app/container_name"    # name
```

Create an `image` from a Dockerfile.

### `docker run`

```
docker run [options] IMAGE
  # see `docker create` for options
```

Run a command in an `image`.

## Manage containers

### `docker create`

```
docker create [options] IMAGE
  -a, --attach               # attach stdout/err
  -i, --interactive          # attach stdin (interactive)
  -t, --tty                  # pseudo-tty
      --name NAME            # name your image
  -p, --publish 5000:5000    # port map
      --expose 5432          # expose a port to linked containers
  -P, --publish-all          # publish all ports
      --link container:alias # linking
  -v, --volume `pwd`:/app    # mount (absolute paths needed)
  -e, --env NAME=hello       # env vars
```

#### Example

```
$ docker create --name app_redis_1 \
  --expose 6379 \
  redis:3.0.2
```

Create a `container` from an `image`.

### `docker exec`

```
docker exec [options] CONTAINER COMMAND
  -d, --detach        # run in background
  -i, --interactive   # stdin
  -t, --tty           # interactive
```

#### Example

```
$ docker exec app_web_1 tail logs/development.log
$ docker exec -t -i app_web_1 rails c
```

Run commands in a `container`.

### `docker start`

```
docker start [options] CONTAINER
  -a, --attach        # attach stdout/err
  -i, --interactive   # attach stdin

docker stop [options] CONTAINER
```

Start/stop a `container`.

### `docker ps`

```
$ docker ps
$ docker ps -a
$ docker kill $ID
```

Manage `container`s using ps/kill.

## Images

### `docker images`

```
$ docker images
  REPOSITORY   TAG        ID
  ubuntu       12.10      b750fe78269d
  me/myapp     latest     7b2431a8d968
```

```
$ docker images -a   # also show intermediate
```

Manages `image`s.

### `docker rmi`

### Inheritance

### Variables

```
docker rmi b750fe78269d
```

### Initialization

```
FROM ruby:2.2.2
```

```
ENV APP_HOME /myapp
RUN mkdir $APP_HOME
```

### Onbuild

```
RUN bundle install
```

### Commands

```
WORKDIR /myapp
```

### Entrypoint

```
VOLUME ["/data"]
# Specification for mount point
```

Configures a container that will run as an executable.

This will use shell processing to substitute shell variables, and will ignore any `CMD` or `docker run` command line arguments.

### Metadata

```
ADD file.xyz /file.xyz
COPY --chown=user:group host_file.xyz /path/container_file.xyz
```

```
ONBUILD RUN bundle install
# when used with another file
```
