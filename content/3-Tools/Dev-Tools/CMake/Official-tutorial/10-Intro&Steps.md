## Introduction
----------------------------------------------------------

The CMake tutorial provides a step-by-step guide that covers common build system issues that CMake helps address. Seeing how various topics all work together in an example project can be very helpful.

## Steps
--------------------------------------------

The tutorial source code examples are available in [`this archive`](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/_downloads/5007e33e60842417a56ac4dc34b9b885/cmake-3.27.0-rc4-tutorial-source.zip). Each step has its own subdirectory containing code that may be used as a starting point. The tutorial examples are progressive so that each step provides the complete solution for the previous step.
