# NetLogo Assignment

Take one of the models in NetLogo's library and use it to simulate a real-life situation as closely as possible. A good example would be to tweak the Virus model in the Alternative Visualizations folder to show how it can be used to model the spread of COVID-19. Can you build a model that mimics a real life viral spread?

Show your work by saving a copy and building a video demo explaining how the model is connected to a real-world situation.
