## Horner's Method

Given a polynomial of the form $c_{n}x^{n} + c_{n-1}x^{n-1} + c_{n-2}x^{n-2} + … + c_{1}x + c_{0}$ and a value of $x$, find the value of polynomial for a given value of $x$. Here $c_{n}, c_{n-1}, ...$ are integers (may be negative) and $n$ is a positive integer.  

Input is in the form of an array say `poly[]` where `poly[0]` represents coefficient for $x_{n}$ and `poly[1]` represents coefficient for $x_{n-1}$ and so on.  

**Examples:** 
```

// Evaluate value of 2x^3 - 6x^2 + 2x - 1 for x = 3
Input: poly[] = {2, -6, 2, -1}, x = 3
Output: 5

// Evaluate value of 2x^3 + 3x + 1 for x = 2
Input: poly[] = {2, 0, 3, 1}, x = 2
Output: 23
```

A naive way to evaluate a polynomial is to one by one evaluate all terms. First calculate $x^{n}$, multiply the value with $c_{n}$ , repeat the same steps for other terms and return the sum. Time complexity of this approach is $\mathcal{O}(n^{2})$ if we use a simple loop for evaluation of $x^{n}$. Time complexity can be improved to $\mathcal{O}(n\log n)$ if we use [[10-algo-basis#快速幂|Quick Power]] algorithm.  

[**Horner’s method**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horner%27s_method) can be used to evaluate polynomial in $\mathcal{O}(n)$ time. To understand the method, let us consider the example of $2x^3 – 6x^2 + 2x – 1$. The polynomial can be evaluated as $((2x – 6)x + 2)x – 1$. The idea is to initialize result as coefficient of $x^n$ which is 2 in this case, repeatedly multiply result with $x$ and add next coefficient to result. Finally return result.  

Following is implementation of Horner’s Method.

```python
# Python program for implementation of Horner Method 
# for Polynomial Evaluation

# returns value of poly[0]x(n-1) + poly[1]x(n-2) + .. + poly[n-1]
def horner(poly, n, x):

	# Initialize result
	result = poly[0] 

	# Evaluate value of polynomial
	# using Horner's method
	for i in range(1, n):

		result = result*x + poly[i]

	return result

# Driver program to
# test above function.

# Let us evaluate value of
# 2x3 - 6x2 + 2x - 1 for x = 3
poly = [2, -6, 2, -1]
x = 3
n = len(poly)

print("Value of polynomial is " , horner(poly, n, x))

```cpp
#include <iostream> 
using namespace std; 

// returns value of poly[0]x(n-1) + poly[1]x(n-2) + .. + poly[n-1] 
int horner(int poly[], int n, int x) 
{ 
	int result = poly[0]; // Initialize result 

	// Evaluate value of polynomial using Horner's method 
	for (int i=1; i<n; i++) 
		result = result*x + poly[i]; 

	return result; 
} 

// Driver program to test above function. 
int main() 
{ 
	// Let us evaluate value of 2x3 - 6x2 + 2x - 1 for x = 3 
	int poly[] = {2, -6, 2, -1}; 
	int x = 3; 
	int n = sizeof(poly)/sizeof(poly[0]); 
	cout << "Value of polynomial is " << horner(poly, n, x); 
	return 0; 
}
