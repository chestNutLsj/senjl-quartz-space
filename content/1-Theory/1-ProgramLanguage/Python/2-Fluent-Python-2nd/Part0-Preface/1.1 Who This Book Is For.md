# Who This Book Is For

This book was written for practicing Python programmers who want to become proficient in Python 3. I tested the examples in Python 3.10â€”most of them also in Python 3.9 and 3.8. When an example requires Python 3.10, it should be clearly marked.

If you are not sure whether you know enough Python to follow along, review the topics of the official [Python tutorial](https://fpy.li/p-3). Topics covered in the tutorial will not be explained here, except for some features that are new.
