# Companion Website: fluentpython.com

Covering new features—like type hints, data classes, and pattern matching—made this second edition almost 30% larger than the first. To keep the book luggable, I moved some content to [_fluentpython.com_](http://fluentpython.com). You will find links to articles I published there in several chapters. Some sample chapters are also in the companion website. The full text is [available online](https://fpy.li/p-4) at the [O’Reilly Learning](https://fpy.li/p-5) subscription service. The example code repository is on [GitHub](https://fpy.li/code).
