## The Evaluator

Now we can appreciate the beauty of Norvig’s expression evaluator—made a little prettier with `match/case`. The `evaluate` function in [Example 18-17](#ex_evaluate_match) takes an `Expression` built by `parse` and an `Environment`.

The body of `evaluate` is a single `match` statement with an expression `exp` as the subject. The `case` patterns express the syntax and semantics of Scheme with amazing clarity.

Let’s study each `case` clause and what it does. In some cases I added comments showing an S-expression that would match the pattern when parsed into a Python list. Doctests extracted from [_examples_test.py_](https://fpy.li/18-21) demonstrate each `case`.
