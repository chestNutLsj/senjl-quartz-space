## Using OR-patterns

A series of patterns separated by `|` is an [_OR-pattern_](https://fpy.li/18-25): it succeeds if any of the subpatterns succeed. The pattern in [“Evaluating numbers”](#eval_atom_sec) is an OR-pattern:

    `case` `int``(``x``)` `|` `float``(``x``):`
        `return` `x`

All subpatterns in an OR-pattern must use the same variables. This restriction is necessary to ensure that the variables are available to the guard expression and the `case` body, regardless of the subpattern that matched.

###### Warning

In the context of a `case` clause, the `|` operator has a special meaning. It does not trigger the `__or__` special method, which handles expressions like `a | b` in other contexts, where it is overloaded to perform operations such as set union or integer bitwise-or, depending on the operands.

An OR-pattern is not restricted to appear at the top level of a pattern. You can also use `|` in subpatterns. For example, if we wanted _lis.py_ to accept the Greek letter λ (lambda)[^12] as well as the `lambda` keyword, we can rewrite the pattern like this:

    `# (λ (a b) (/ (+ a b) 2) )`
    `case` `[``'lambda'` `|` `'λ'``,` `[``*``parms``],` `*``body``]` `if` `body``:`
        `return` `Procedure``(``parms``,` `body``,` `env``)`

Now we can move to the third and last subject of this chapter: the unusual places where an `else` clause may appear in Python.
