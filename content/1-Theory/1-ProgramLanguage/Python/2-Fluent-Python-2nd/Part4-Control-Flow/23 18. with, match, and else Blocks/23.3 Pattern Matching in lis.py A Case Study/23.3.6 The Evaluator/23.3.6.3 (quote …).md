### (quote …)

The `quote` special form treats atoms and lists as data instead of expressions to be evaluated.

    `# (quote (99 bottles of beer))`
    `case` `[``'quote'``,` `x``]:`
        `return` `x`

Subject:

List starting with the symbol `'quote'`, followed by one expression `x`.

Action:

Return `x` without evaluating it.

Examples:

```
>>> 
```

Without `quote`, each expression in the test would raise an error:

- `no-such-name` would be looked up in the environment, raising `KeyError`
    
- `(99 bottles of beer)` cannot be evaluated because the number 99 is not a `Symbol` naming a special form, operator, or function
    
- `(/ 10 0)` would raise `ZeroDivisionError`
    

##### Why Languages Have Reserved Keywords

Although simple, `quote` cannot be implemented as a function in Scheme. Its special power is to prevent the interpreter from evaluating `(f 10)` in the expression `(quote (f 10))`: the result is simply a list with a `Symbol` and an `int`. In contrast, in a function call like `(abs (f 10))`, the interpreter evaluates `(f 10)` before invoking `abs`. That’s why `quote` is a reserved keyword: it must be handled as a special form.

In general, reserved keywords are needed:

- To introduce specialized evaluation rules, as in `quote` and `lambda`—which don’t evaluate any of their subexpressions
    
- To change the control flow, as in `if` and function calls—which also have special evaluation rules
    
- To manage the environment, as in `define` and `set`
    

This is also why Python, and programming languages in general, need reserved keywords. Think about Python’s `def`, `if`, `yield`, `import`, `del`, and what they do.
