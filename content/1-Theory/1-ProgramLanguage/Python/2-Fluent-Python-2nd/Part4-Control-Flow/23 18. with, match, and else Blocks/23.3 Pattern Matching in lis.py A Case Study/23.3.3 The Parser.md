## The Parser

Norvig’s parser is 36 lines of code showcasing the power of Python applied to handling the simple recursive syntax of S-expression—without string data, comments, macros, and other features of standard Scheme that make parsing more complicated ([Example 18-13](#lis_parser_ex)).

##### Example 18-13. lis.py: the main parsing functions

```
def
```

The main function of that group is `parse`, which takes an S-expression as a `str` and returns an `Expression` object, as defined in [Example 18-12](#lis_top_ex): an `Atom` or a `list` that may contain more atoms and nested lists.

Norvig uses a smart trick in `tokenize`: he adds spaces before and after each parenthesis in the input and then splits it, resulting in a list of syntactic tokens with `'('` and `')'` as separate tokens. This shortcut works because there is no string type in the little Scheme of _lis.py_, so every `'('` or `')'` is an expression delimiter. The recursive parsing code is in `read_from_tokens`, a 14-line function that you can read in the [_fluentpython/example-code-2e_](https://fpy.li/18-17) repository. I will skip it because I want to focus on the other parts of the interpreter.

Here are some doctests extracted from [_lispy/py3.10/examples_test.py_](https://fpy.li/18-18):

The parsing rules for this subset of Scheme are simple:

1. A token that looks like a number is parsed as a `float` or `int`.
    
2. Anything else that is not `'('` or `')'` is parsed as a `Symbol`—a `str` to be used as an identifier. This includes source text like `+`, `set!`, and `make-counter` that are valid identifiers in Scheme but not in Python.
    
3. Expressions inside `'('` and `')'` are recursively parsed as lists containing atoms or as nested lists that may contain atoms and more nested lists.
    

Using the terminology of the Python interpreter, the output of `parse` is an AST (Abstract Syntax Tree): a convenient representation of the Scheme program as nested lists forming a tree-like structure, where the outermost list is the trunk, inner lists are the branches, and atoms are the leaves ([Figure 18-1](#ast_fig)).
