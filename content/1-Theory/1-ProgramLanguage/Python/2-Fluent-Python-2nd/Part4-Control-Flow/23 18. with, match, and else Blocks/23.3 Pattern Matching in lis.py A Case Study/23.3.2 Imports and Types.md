## Imports and Types

[Example 18-12](#lis_top_ex) shows the first lines of _lis.py_. The use of `TypeAlias` and the `|` type union operator require Python 3.10.

##### Example 18-12. lis.py: top of the file

```
import
```

The types defined are:

`Symbol`

Just an alias for `str`. In _lis.py_, `Symbol` is used for identifiers; there is no string data type with operations such as slicing, splitting, etc.[^8]

`Atom`

A simple syntactic element, such as a number or a `Symbol`—as opposed to a composite structure made of distinct parts, like a list.

`Expression`

The building blocks of Scheme programs are expressions made of atoms and lists, possibly nested.
