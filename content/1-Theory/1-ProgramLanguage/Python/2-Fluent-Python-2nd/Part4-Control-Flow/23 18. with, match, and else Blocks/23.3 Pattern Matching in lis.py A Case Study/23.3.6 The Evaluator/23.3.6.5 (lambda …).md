### (lambda …)

Scheme’s `lambda` form defines anonymous functions. It doesn’t suffer from the limitations of Python’s `lambda`: any function that can be written in Scheme can be written using the `(lambda …)` syntax.

    `# (lambda (a b) (/ (+ a b) 2))`
    `case` `[``'lambda'` `[``*``parms``],` `*``body``]` `if` `body``:`
        `return` `Procedure``(``parms``,` `body``,` `env``)`

Subject:

List starting with `'lambda'`, followed by:

- List of zero or more parameter names.
    
- One or more expressions collected in `body` (the guard ensures that `body` is not empty).
    

Action:

Create and return a new `Procedure` instance with the parameter names, the list of expressions as the body, and the current environment.

Example:

```
>>> 
```

The `Procedure` class implements the concept of a closure: a callable object holding parameter names, a function body, and a reference to the environment in which the function is defined. We’ll study the code for `Procedure` in a moment.
