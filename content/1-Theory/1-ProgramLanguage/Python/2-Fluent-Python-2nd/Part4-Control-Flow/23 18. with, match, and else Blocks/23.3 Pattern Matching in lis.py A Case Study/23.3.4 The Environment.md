## The Environment

The `Environment` class extends `collections.ChainMap`, adding a `change` method to update a value inside one of the chained dicts, which `ChainMap` instances hold in a list of mappings: the `self.maps` attribute. The `change` method is needed to support the Scheme `(set! …)` form, described later; see [Example 18-14](#environment_class_ex).

##### Example 18-14. _lis.py_: the `Environment` class

```

```

Note that the `change` method only updates existing keys.[^9] Trying to change a key that is not found raises `KeyError`.

This doctest shows how `Environment` works:

```

[![^1]

When reading values, `Environment` works as `ChainMap`: keys are searched in the nested mappings from left to right. That’s why the value of `a` in the `outer_env` is shadowed by the value in `inner_env`.

[![^2]

Assigning with `[]` overwrites or inserts new items, but always in the first mapping, `inner_env` in this example.

[![^3]

`env.change('b', 333)` seeks the `'b'` key and assigns a new value to it in-place, in the `outer_env`.

Next is the `standard_env()` function, which builds and returns an `Environment` loaded with predefined functions, similar to Python’s `__builtins__` module that is always available ([Example 18-15](#lis_std_env_ex)).

##### Example 18-15. lis.py: `standard_env()` builds and returns the global environment

```

```

To summarize, the `env` mapping is loaded with:

- All functions from Python’s `math` module
    
- Selected operators from Python’s `op` module
    
- Simple but powerful functions built with Python’s `lambda`
    
- Python built-ins renamed, like `callable` as `procedure?`, or directly mapped, like `round`
