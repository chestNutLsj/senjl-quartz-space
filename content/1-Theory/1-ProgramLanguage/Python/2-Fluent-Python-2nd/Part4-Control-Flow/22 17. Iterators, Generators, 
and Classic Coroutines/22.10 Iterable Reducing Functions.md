# Iterable Reducing Functions

The functions in [Table 17-6](#tbl_iter_reducing) all take an iterable and return a single result. They are known as “reducing,” “folding,” or “accumulating” functions. We can implement every one of the built-ins listed here with `functools.reduce`, but they exist as built-ins because they address some common use cases more easily. A longer explanation about `functools.reduce` appeared in [“Vector Take #4: Hashing and a Faster ==”](ch12.html#multi_hashing).

In the case of `all` and `any`, there is an important optimization `functools.reduce` does not support: `all` and `any` short-circuit—i.e., they stop consuming the iterator as soon as the result is determined. See the last test with `any` in [Example 17-24](#all_any_demo).

Table 17-6. Built-in functions that read iterables and return single values
|Module|Function|Description|
|---|---|---|
|(built-in)|`all(it)`|Returns `True` if all items in `it` are truthy, otherwise `False`; `all([])` returns `True`|
|(built-in)|`any(it)`|Returns `True` if any item in `it` is truthy, otherwise `False`; `any([])` returns `False`|
|(built-in)|`max(it, [key=,] [default=])`|Returns the maximum value of the items in `it`;[a](ch17.html#idm46582401427632) `key` is an ordering function, as in `sorted`; `default` is returned if the iterable is empty|
|(built-in)|`min(it, [key=,] [default=])`|Returns the minimum value of the items in `it`.[b](ch17.html#idm46582401422464) `key` is an ordering function, as in `sorted`; `default` is returned if the iterable is empty|
|`functools`|`reduce(func, it, [initial])`|Returns the result of applying `func` to the first pair of items, then to that result and the third item, and so on; if given, `initial` forms the initial pair with the first item|
|(built-in)|`sum(it, start=0)`|The sum of all items in `it`, with the optional `start` value added (use `math.fsum` for better precision when adding floats)|
|[a](ch17.html#idm46582401427632-marker) May also be called as `max(arg1, arg2, …, [key=?])`, in which case the maximum among the arguments is returned.<br><br>[b](ch17.html#idm46582401422464-marker) May also be called as `min(arg1, arg2, …, [key=?])`, in which case the minimum among the arguments is returned.|   |   |

The operation of `all` and `any` is exemplified in [Example 17-24](#all_any_demo).

##### Example 17-24. Results of `all` and `any` for some sequences

```
>>> 
```

[![^1]

`any` iterated over `g` until `g` yielded `7`; then `any` stopped and returned `True`.

[![^2]

That’s why `8` was still remaining.

Another built-in that takes an iterable and returns something else is `sorted`. Unlike `reversed`, which is a generator function, `sorted` builds and returns a new `list`. After all, every single item of the input iterable must be read so they can be sorted, and the sorting happens in a `list`, therefore `sorted` just returns that `list` after it’s done. I mention `sorted` here because it does consume an arbitrary iterable.

Of course, `sorted` and the reducing functions only work with iterables that eventually stop. Otherwise, they will keep on collecting items and never return a result.

###### Note

If you’ve gotten this far, you’ve seen the most important and useful content of this chapter. The remaining sections cover advanced generator features that most of us don’t see or need very often, such as the `yield from` construct and classic coroutines.

There are also sections about type hinting iterables, iterators, and classic coroutines.

The `yield from` syntax provides a new way of combining generators. That’s next.
