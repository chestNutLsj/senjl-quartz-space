# Subgenerators with yield from

The `yield from` expression syntax was introduced in Python 3.3 to allow a generator to delegate work to a subgenerator.

Before `yield from` was introduced, we used a `for` loop when a generator needed to yield values produced from another generator:

```
>>> 
```

We can get the same result using `yield from`, as you can see in [Example 17-25](#ex_simple_yield_from).

##### Example 17-25. Test-driving `yield from`

```
>>> 
```

In [Example 17-25](#ex_simple_yield_from), the `for` loop is the _client code_, `gen` is the _delegating generator_, and `sub_gen` is the _subgenerator_. Note that `yield from` pauses `gen`, and `sub_gen` takes over until it is exhausted. The values yielded by `sub_gen` pass through `gen` directly to the client `for` loop. Meanwhile, `gen` is suspended and cannot see the values passing through it. Only when `sub_gen` is done, `gen` resumes.

When the subgenerator contains a `return` statement with a value, that value can be captured in the delegating generator by using `yield from` as part of an expression. [Example 17-26](#ex_simple_yield_from_return) demonstrates.

##### Example 17-26. `yield from` gets the return value of the subgenerator

```
>>> 
```

Now that we’ve seen the basics of `yield from`, let’s study a couple of simple but practical examples of its use.
