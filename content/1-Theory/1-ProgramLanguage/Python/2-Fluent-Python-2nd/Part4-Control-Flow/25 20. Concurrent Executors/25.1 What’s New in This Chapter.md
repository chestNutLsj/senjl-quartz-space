# What’s New in This Chapter

I renamed the chapter from “Concurrency with Futures” to “Concurrent Executors” because the executors are the most important high-level feature covered here. Futures are low-level objects, focused on in [“Where Are the Futures?”](#where_futures_sec), but mostly invisible in the rest of the chapter.

All the HTTP client examples now use the new [_HTTPX_](https://fpy.li/httpx) library, which provides synchronous and asynchronous APIs.

The setup for the experiments in [“Downloads with Progress Display and Error Handling”](#flags2_sec) is now simpler, thanks to the multithreaded server added to the [`http.server`](https://fpy.li/20-2) package in Python 3.7. Previously, the standard library only had the single-threaded `BaseHttpServer`, which was no good for experimenting with concurrent clients, so I had to resort to external tools in the first edition of this book.

[“Launching Processes with concurrent.futures”](#launching_processes_sec) now demonstrates how an executor simplifies the code we saw in [“Code for the Multicore Prime Checker”](ch19.html#code_for_multicore_prime_sec).

Finally, I moved most of the theory to the new [Chapter 19, “Concurrency Models in Python”](ch19.html#concurrency_models_ch).
