# Further Reading

David Beazley’s PyOhio 2016 keynote [“Fear and Awaiting in Async”](https://fpy.li/21-61) is a fantastic, live-coded introduction to the potential of the language features made possible by Yury Selivanov’s contribution of the `async/await` keywords in Python 3.5. At one point, Beazley complains that `await` can’t be used in list comprehensions, but that was fixed by Selivanov in [PEP 530—Asynchronous Comprehensions](https://fpy.li/pep530), implemented in Python 3.6 later in that same year. Apart from that, everything else in Beazley’s keynote is timeless, as he demonstrates how the asynchronous objects we saw in this chapter work, without the help of any framework—just a simple `run` function using `.send(None)` to drive coroutines. Only at the very end Beazley shows [_Curio_](https://fpy.li/21-62), which he started that year as an experiment to see how far can you go doing asynchronous programming without a foundation of callbacks or futures, just coroutines. As it turns out, you can go very far—as demonstrated by the evolution of _Curio_ and the later creation of [_Trio_](https://fpy.li/21-58) by Nathaniel J. Smith. _Curio’s_ documentation has [links](https://fpy.li/21-64) to more talks by Beazley on the subject.

Besides starting _Trio_, Nathaniel J. Smith wrote two deep blog posts that I highly recommend: [“Some thoughts on asynchronous API design in a post-async/await world”](https://fpy.li/21-65), contrasting the design of _Curio_ with that of _asyncio_,and [“Notes on structured concurrency, or: Go statement considered harmful”](https://fpy.li/21-66), about structured concurrency. Smith also gave a long and informative answer to the question: [“What is the core difference between asyncio and trio?”](https://fpy.li/21-67) on StackOverflow.

To learn more about the _asyncio_ package, I’ve mentioned the best written resources I know at the start of this chapter: the [official documentation](https://fpy.li/21-1) after the outstanding [overhaul](https://fpy.li/21-69) started by Yury Selivanov in 2018, and Caleb Hattingh’s book [_Using Asyncio in Python_](https://fpy.li/hattingh) (O’Reilly). In the official documentation, make sure to read [“Developing with asyncio”](https://fpy.li/21-70): documenting the _asyncio_ debug mode, and also discussing common mistakes and traps and how to avoid them.

For a very accessible, 30-minute introduction to asynchronous programming in general and also _asyncio_, watch Miguel Grinberg’s [“Asynchronous Python for the Complete Beginner”](https://fpy.li/21-71), presented at PyCon 2017. Another great introduction is [“Demystifying Python’s Async and Await Keywords”](https://fpy.li/21-72), presented by Michael Kennedy, where among other things I learned about the [_unsync_](https://fpy.li/21-73) library that provides a decorator to delegate the execution of coroutines, I/O-bound functions, and CPU-bound functions to `asyncio`, `threading`, or `multiprocessing` as needed.

At EuroPython 2019, Lynn Root—a global leader of [_PyLadies_](https://fpy.li/21-74)—presented the excellent [“Advanced asyncio: Solving Real-world Production Problems”](https://fpy.li/21-75), informed by her experience using Python as a staff engineer at Spotify.

In 2020, Łukasz Langa recorded a series of great videos about _asyncio_, starting with [“Learn Python’s AsyncIO #1—The Async Ecosystem”](https://fpy.li/21-76). Langa also made the super cool video [“AsyncIO + Music”](https://fpy.li/21-77) for PyCon 2020 that not only shows _asyncio_ applied in a very concrete event-oriented domain, but also explains it from the ground up.

Another area dominated by event-oriented programming is embedded systems. That’s why Damien George added support for `async/await` in his [_MicroPython_](https://fpy.li/21-78) interpreter for microcontrollers. At PyCon Australia 2018, Matt Trentini demonstrated the [_uasyncio_](https://fpy.li/21-79) library, a subset of _asyncio_ that is part of MicroPython’s standard library.

For higher-level thinking about async programming in Python, read the blog post [“Python async frameworks—Beyond developer tribalism”](https://fpy.li/21-80) by Tom Christie.

Finally, I recommend [“What Color Is Your Function?”](https://fpy.li/21-81) by Bob Nystrom, discussing the incompatible execution models of plain functions versus async functions—a.k.a. coroutines—in JavaScript, Python, C#, and other languages. Spoiler alert: Nystrom’s conclusion is that the language that got this right is Go, where all functions are the same color. I like that about Go. But I also think Nathaniel J. Smith has a point when he wrote [“Go statement considered harmful”](https://fpy.li/21-66). Nothing is perfect, and concurrent programming is always hard.

##### Soapbox

How a Slow Function Almost Spoiled the uvloop Benchmarks

In 2016, Yury Selivanov released [_uvloop_](https://fpy.li/21-83), “a fast, drop-in replacement of the built-in _asyncio_ event loop.” The benchmarks presented in Selivanov’s [blog post](https://fpy.li/21-84) announcing the library in 2016 are very impressive. He wrote: “it is at least 2x faster than nodejs, gevent, as well as any other Python asynchronous framework. The performance of uvloop-based asyncio is close to that of Go programs.”

However, the post reveals that _uvloop_ is able to match the performance of Go under two conditions:

1. Go is configured to use a single thread. That makes the Go runtime behave similarly to _asyncio_: concurrency is achieved via multiple coroutines driven by an event loop, all in the same thread.[^20]
    
2. The Python 3.5 code uses [_httptools_](https://fpy.li/21-85) in addition to _uvloop_ itself.
    

Selivanov explains that he wrote _httptools_ after benchmarking _uvloop_ with [_aiohttp_](https://fpy.li/21-86)—one of the first full-featured HTTP libraries built on `asyncio`:

> However, the performance bottleneck in _aiohttp_ turned out to be its HTTP parser, which is so slow, that it matters very little how fast the underlying I/O library is. To make things more interesting, we created a Python binding for _http-parser_ (Node.js HTTP parser C library, originally developed for _NGINX_). The library is called _httptools_, and is available on Github and PyPI.

Now think about that: Selivanov’s HTTP performance tests consisted of a simple echo server written in the different languages/libraries, pounded by the [_wrk_](https://fpy.li/21-87) benchmarking tool. Most developers would consider a simple echo server an “I/O-bound system,” right? But it turned out that parsing HTTP headers is CPU bound, and it had a slow Python implementation in _aiohttp_ in when Selivanov did the benchmarks in 2016. Whenever a function written in Python was parsing headers, the event loop was blocked. The impact was so significant that Selivanov went to the extra trouble of writing _httptools_. Without optimizing the CPU-bound code, the performance gains of a faster event loop were lost.

Death by a Thousand Cuts

Instead of a simple echo server, imagine a complex and evolving Python system with tens of thousands of lines of asynchronous code, interfacing with many external libraries. Years ago I was asked to help diagnose performance problems in a system like that. It was written in Python 2.7 with the [_Twisted_](https://fpy.li/21-88) framework—a solid library and in many ways a precursor to `asyncio` itself.

Python was used to build a façade for the web UI, integrating functionality provided by preexisting libraries and command-line tools written in other languages—but not designed for concurrent execution.

The project was ambitious; it had been in development for more than a year already, but it was not in production yet.[^21] Over time, the developers noticed that the performance of the whole system was decreasing, and they were having a hard time finding the bottlenecks.

What was happening: with each added feature, more CPU-bound code was slowing down _Twisted_’s event loop. Python’s role as a glue language meant there was a lot of data parsing and conversion between formats. There wasn’t a single bottleneck: the problem was spread over countless little functions added over months of development. Fixing that would require rethinking the architecture of the system, rewriting a lot of code, probably leveraging a task queue, and perhaps using microservices or custom libraries written in languages better suited for CPU-intensive concurrent processing. The stakeholders were not prepared to make that additional investment, and the project was cancelled shortly afterwards.

When I told this story to Glyph Lefkowitz—founder the _Twisted_ project—he said that one of his priorities at the start of an asynchronous programming project is to decide which tools he will use to farm out the CPU-intensive tasks. This conversation with Glyph was the inspiration for [“Avoiding CPU-Bound Traps”](#avoid_cpu_trap_sec).
