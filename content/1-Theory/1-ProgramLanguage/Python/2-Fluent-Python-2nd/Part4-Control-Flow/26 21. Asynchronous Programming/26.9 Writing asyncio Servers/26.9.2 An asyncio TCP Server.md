## An asyncio TCP Server

The _tcp_mojifinder.py_ program uses plain TCP to communicate with a client like Telnet or Netcat, so I could write it using `asyncio` without external dependencies—and without reinventing HTTP. [Figure 21-5](#tcp_mojifinder_demo) shows text-based UI.

###### Figure 21-5. Telnet session with the tcp_mojifinder.py server: querying for “fire.”

This program is twice as long as _web_mojifinder.py_, so I split the presentation into three parts: [Example 21-12](#tcp_mojifinder_main), [Example 21-14](#tcp_mojifinder_top), and [Example 21-15](#tcp_mojifinder_search). The top of _tcp_mojifinder.py_—including the `import` statements—is in [Example 21-14](#tcp_mojifinder_top), but I will start by describing the `supervisor` coroutine and the `main` function that drives the program.

##### Example 21-12. tcp_mojifinder.py: a simple TCP server; continues in [Example 21-14](#tcp_mojifinder_top)

```
async
```

[![^1]

This `await` quickly gets an instance of `asyncio.Server`, a TCP socket server. By default, `start_server` creates and starts the server, so it’s ready to receive connections.

[![^2]

The first argument to `start_server` is `client_connected_cb`, a callback to run when a new client connection starts. The callback can be a function or a coroutine, but it must accept exactly two arguments: an `asyncio.StreamReader` and an `asyncio.StreamWriter`. However, my `finder` coroutine also needs to get an `index`, so I used `functools.partial` to bind that parameter and obtain a callable that takes the reader and writer. Adapting user functions to callback APIs is the most common use case for `functools.partial`.

[![^3]

`host` and `port` are the second and third arguments to `start_server`. See the full signature in the [`asyncio` documentation](https://fpy.li/21-35).

[![^4]

This `cast` is needed because _typeshed_ has an outdated type hint for the `sockets` property of the `Server` class—as of May 2021. See [Issue #5535 on _typeshed_](https://fpy.li/21-36).[^13]

[![^5]

Display the address and port of the first socket of the server.

[![^6]

Although `start_server` already started the server as a concurrent task, I need to `await` on the `server_forever` method so that my `supervisor` is suspended here. Without this line, `supervisor` would return immediately, ending the loop started with `asyncio.run(supervisor(…))`, and exiting the program. The [documentation for `Server.serve_forever`](https://fpy.li/21-37) says: “This method can be called if the server is already accepting connections.”

[![^7]

Build the inverted index.[^14]

[![^8]

Start the event loop running `supervisor`.

[![^9]

Catch the `KeyboardInterrupt` to avoid a distracting traceback when I stop the server with Ctrl-C on the terminal running it.

You may find it easier to understand how control flows in _tcp_mojifinder.py_ if you study the output it generates on the server console, listed in [Example 21-13](#tcp_mojifinder_server_demo).

##### Example 21-13. tcp_mojifinder.py: this is the server side of the session depicted in [Figure 21-5](#tcp_mojifinder_demo)

```
$ python3 tcp_mojifinder.py
Building index.  
```

[![^1]

Output by `main`. Before the next line appears, I see a 0.6s delay on my machine while the index is built.

[![^2]

Output by `supervisor`.

[![^3]

First iteration of a `while` loop in `finder`. The TCP/IP stack assigned port 58192 to my Telnet client. If you connect several clients to the server, you’ll see their various ports in the output.

[![^4]

Second iteration of the `while` loop in `finder`.

[![^5]

I hit Ctrl-C on the client terminal; the `while` loop in `finder` exits.

[![^6]

The `finder` coroutine displays this message then exits. Meanwhile the server is still running, ready to service another client.

[![^7]

I hit Ctrl-C on the server terminal; `server.serve_forever` is cancelled, ending `supervisor` and the event loop.

[![^8]

Output by `main`.

After `main` builds the index and starts the event loop, `supervisor` quickly displays the `Serving on…` message and is suspended at the `await server.serve_forever()` line. At that point, control flows into the event loop and stays there, occasionally coming back to the `finder` coroutine, which yields control back to the event loop whenever it needs to wait for the network to send or receive data.

While the event loop is alive, a new instance of the `finder` coroutine will be started for each client that connects to the server. In this way, many clients can be handled concurrently by this simple server. This continues until a `KeyboardInterrupt` occurs on the server or its process is killed by the OS.

Now let’s see the top of _tcp_mojifinder.py_, with the `finder` coroutine.

##### Example 21-14. tcp_mojifinder.py: continued from [Example 21-12](#tcp_mojifinder_main)

```
import
```

[![^1]

`format_results` is useful to display the results of `InvertedIndex.search` in a text-based UI such as the command line or a Telnet session.

[![^2]

To pass `finder` to `asyncio.start_server`, I wrapped it with `functools.partial`, because the server expects a coroutine or function that takes only the `reader` and `writer` arguments.

[![^3]

Get the remote client address to which the socket is connected.

[![^4]

This loop handles a dialog that lasts until a control character is received from the client.

[![^5]

The `StreamWriter.write` method is not a coroutine, just a plain function; this line sends the `?>` prompt.

[![^6]

`StreamWriter.drain` flushes the `writer` buffer; it is a coroutine, so it must be driven with `await`.

[![^7]

`StreamWriter.readline` is a coroutine that returns `bytes`.

[![^8]

If no bytes were received, the client closed the connection, so exit the loop.

[![^9]

Decode the `bytes` to `str`, using the default UTF-8 encoding.

[![^10]

A `UnicodeDecodeError` may happen when the user hits Ctrl-C and the Telnet client sends control bytes; if that happens, replace the query with a null character, for simplicity.

[![^11]

Log the query to the server console.

[![^12]

Exit the loop if a control or null character was received.

[![^13]

Do the actual `search`; code is presented next.

[![^14]

Log the response to the server console.

[![^15]

Close the `StreamWriter`.

[![^16]

Wait for the `StreamWriter` to close. This is recommended in the [`.close()` method documentation](https://fpy.li/21-38).

[![^17]

Log the end of this client’s session to the server console.

The last piece of this example is the `search` coroutine, shown in [Example 21-15](#tcp_mojifinder_search).

##### Example 21-15. tcp_mojifinder.py: `search` coroutine

```
async
```

[![^1]

`search` must be a coroutine because it writes to a `StreamWriter` and must use its `.drain()` coroutine method.

[![^2]

Query the inverted index.

[![^3]

This generator expression will yield byte strings encoded in UTF-8 with the Unicode codepoint, the actual character, its name, and a `CRLF` sequence—e.g., `b'U+0039\t9\tDIGIT NINE\r\n'`).

[![^4]

Send the `lines`. Surprisingly, `writer.writelines` is not a coroutine.

[![^5]

But `writer.drain()` is a coroutine. Don’t forget the `await`!

[![^6]

Build a status line, then send it.

Note that all network I/O in _tcp_mojifinder.py_ is in `bytes`; we need to decode the `bytes` received from the network, and encode strings before sending them out. In Python 3, the default encoding is UTF-8, and that’s what I used implicitly in all `encode` and `decode` calls in this example.

###### Warning

Note that some of the I/O methods are coroutines and must be driven with `await`, while others are simple functions. For example, `StreamWriter.write` is a plain function, because it writes to a buffer. On the other hand, `StreamWriter.drain`—which flushes the buffer and performs the network I/O—is a coroutine, as is `StreamReader.readline`—but not `StreamWriter.writelines`! While I was writing the first edition of this book, the `asyncio` API docs were improved by [clearly labeling coroutines as such](https://fpy.li/21-39).

The _tcp_mojifinder.py_ code leverages the high-level `asyncio` [Streams API](https://fpy.li/21-40) that provides a ready-to-use server so you only need to implement a handler function, which can be a plain callback or a coroutine. There is also a lower-level [Transports and Protocols API](https://fpy.li/21-41), inspired by the transport and protocols abstractions in the _Twisted_ framework. Refer to the `asyncio` documentation for more information, including [TCP and UDP echo servers and clients](https://fpy.li/21-42) implemented with that lower-level API.

Our next topic is `async for` and the objects that make it work.
