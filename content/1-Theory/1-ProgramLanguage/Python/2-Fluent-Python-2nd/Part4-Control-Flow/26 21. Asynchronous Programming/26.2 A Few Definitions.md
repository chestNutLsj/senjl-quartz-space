# A Few Definitions

At the start of [“Classic Coroutines”](ch17.html#classic_coroutines_sec), we saw that Python 3.5 and later offer three kinds of coroutines:

Native coroutine

A coroutine function defined with `async def`. You can delegate from a native coroutine to another native coroutine using the `await` keyword, similar to how classic coroutines use `yield from`. The `async def` statement always defines a native coroutine, even if the `await` keyword is not used in its body. The `await` keyword cannot be used outside of a native coroutine.[^3]

Classic coroutine

A generator function that consumes data sent to it via `my_coro.send(data)` calls, and reads that data by using `yield` in an expression. Classic coroutines can delegate to other classic coroutines using `yield from`. Classic coroutines cannot be driven by `await`, and are no longer supported by _asyncio_.

Generator-based coroutine

A generator function decorated with `@types.coroutine`—introduced in Python 3.5. That decorator makes the generator compatible with the new `await` keyword.

In this chapter, we focus on native coroutines as well as _asynchronous generators_:

Asynchronous generator

A generator function defined with `async def` and using `yield` in its body. It returns an asynchronous generator object that provides `__anext__`, a coroutine method to retrieve the next item.

# @asyncio.coroutine has No Future[^4]

The `@asyncio.coroutine` decorator for classic coroutines and generator-based coroutines was deprecated in Python 3.8 and is scheduled for removal in Python 3.11, according to [Issue 43216](https://fpy.li/21-2). In contrast, `@types.coroutine` should remain, per [Issue 36921](https://fpy.li/21-3). It is no longer supported by _asyncio_, but is used in low-level code in the _Curio_ and _Trio_ asynchronous frameworks.
