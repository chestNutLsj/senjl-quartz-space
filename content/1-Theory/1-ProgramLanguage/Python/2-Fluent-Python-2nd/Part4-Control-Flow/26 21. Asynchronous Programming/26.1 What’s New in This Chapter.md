# What’s New in This Chapter

When I wrote the first edition of _Fluent Python_, the _asyncio_ library was provisional and the `async/await` keywords did not exist. Therefore, I had to update all examples in this chapter. I also created new examples: domain probing scripts, a _FastAPI_ web service, and experiments with Python’s new asynchronous console mode.

New sections cover language features that did not exist at the time, such as native coroutines, `async with`, `async for`, and the objects that support those constructs.

The ideas in [“How Async Works and How It Doesn’t”](#how_async_works_and_does_not_sec) reflect hard-earned lessons that I consider essential reading for anyone using asynchronous programming. They may save you a lot of trouble—whether you’re using Python or Node.js.

Finally, I removed several paragraphs about `asyncio.Futures`, which is now considered part of the low-level _asyncio_ APIs.
