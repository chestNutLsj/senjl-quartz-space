## The Myth of I/O-Bound Systems

A commonly repeated meme is that asynchronous programming is good for “I/O bound systems.” I learned the hard way that there are no “I/O-bound systems.” You may have I/O-bound _functions_. Perhaps the vast majority of the functions in your system are I/O bound; i.e., they spend more time waiting for I/O than crunching data. While waiting, they cede control to the event loop, which can then drive some other pending task. But inevitably, any nontrivial system will have some parts that are CPU bound. Even trivial systems reveal that, under stress. In [“Soapbox”](#async_soapbox), I tell the story of two asynchronous programs that struggled with CPU-bound functions slowing down the event loop with severe impact on performance.

Given that any nontrivial system will have CPU-bound functions, dealing with them is the key to success in asynchronous programming.
