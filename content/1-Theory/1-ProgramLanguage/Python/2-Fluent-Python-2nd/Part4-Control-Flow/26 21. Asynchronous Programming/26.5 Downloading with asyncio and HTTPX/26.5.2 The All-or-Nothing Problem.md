## The All-or-Nothing Problem

Note that in [Example 21-3](#flags_asyncio_ex), I could not reuse the `get_flag` function from _flags.py_ ([Example 20-2](ch20.html#flags_module_ex)). I had to rewrite it as a coroutine to use the asynchronous API of _HTTPX_. For peak performance with _asyncio_, we must replace every function that does I/O with an asynchronous version that is activated with `await` or `asyncio.create_task`, so that control is given back to the event loop while the function waits for I/O. If you can’t rewrite a blocking function as a coroutine, you should run it in a separate thread or process, as we’ll see in [“Delegating Tasks to Executors”](#delegating_to_executors_sec).

That’s why I chose the epigraph for this chapter, which includes this advice: “You rewrite all your code so none of it blocks or you’re just wasting your time.”

For the same reason, I could not reuse the `download_one` function from _flags_threadpool.py_ ([Example 20-3](ch20.html#flags_threadpool_ex)) either. The code in [Example 21-3](#flags_asyncio_ex) drives `get_flag` with `await`, so `download_one` must also be a coroutine. For each request, a `download_one` coroutine object is created in `supervisor`, and they are all driven by the `asyncio.gather` coroutine.

Now let’s study the `async with` statement that appeared in `supervisor` ([Example 21-2](#flags_asyncio_start_ex)) and `get_flag` ([Example 21-3](#flags_asyncio_ex)).
