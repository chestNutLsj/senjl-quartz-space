## The Secret of Native Coroutines: Humble Generators

A key difference between the classic coroutine examples we saw in [“Classic Coroutines”](ch17.html#classic_coroutines_sec) and _flags_asyncio.py_ is that there are no visible `.send()` calls or `yield` expressions in the latter. Your code sits between the _asyncio_ library and the asynchronous libraries you are using, such as _HTTPX_. This is illustrated in [Figure 21-1](#await_channel_fig).

###### Figure 21-1. In an asynchronous program, a user’s function starts the event loop, scheduling an initial coroutine with `asyncio.run`. Each user’s coroutine drives the next with an `await` expression, forming a channel that enables communication between a library like _HTTPX_ and the event loop.

Under the hood, the `asyncio` event loop makes the `.send` calls that drive your coroutines, and your coroutines `await` on other coroutines, including library coroutines. As mentioned, `await` borrows most of its implementation from `yield from`, which also makes `.send` calls to drive coroutines.

The `await` chain eventually reaches a low-level awaitable, which returns a generator that the event loop can drive in response to events such as timers or network I/O. The low-level awaitables and generators at the end of these `await` chains are implemented deep into the libraries, are not part of their APIs, and may be Python/C extensions.

Using functions like `asyncio.gather` and `asyncio.create_task`, you can start multiple concurrent `await` channels, enabling concurrent execution of multiple I/O operations driven by a single event loop, in a single thread.
