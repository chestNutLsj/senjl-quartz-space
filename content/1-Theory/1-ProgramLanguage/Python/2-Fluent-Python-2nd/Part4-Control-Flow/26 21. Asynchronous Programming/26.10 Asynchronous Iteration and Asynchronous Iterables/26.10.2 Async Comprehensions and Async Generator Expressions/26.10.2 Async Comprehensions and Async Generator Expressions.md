## Async Comprehensions and Async Generator Expressions

[PEP 530â€”Asynchronous Comprehensions](https://fpy.li/pep530) introduced the use of `async for` and `await` in the syntax of comprehensions and generator expressions, starting with Python 3.6.

The only construct defined by PEP 530 that can appear outside an `async def` body is an asynchronous generator expression.
