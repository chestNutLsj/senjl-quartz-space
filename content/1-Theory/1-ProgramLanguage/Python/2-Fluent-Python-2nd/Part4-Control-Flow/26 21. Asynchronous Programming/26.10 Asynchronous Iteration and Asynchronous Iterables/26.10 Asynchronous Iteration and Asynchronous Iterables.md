# Asynchronous Iteration and Asynchronous Iterables

We saw in [“Asynchronous Context Managers”](#async_context_manager_sec) how `async with` works with objects implementing the `__aenter__` and `__aexit__` methods returning awaitables—usually in the form of coroutine objects.

Similarly, `async for` works with _asynchronous iterables_: objects that implement `__aiter__`. However, `__aiter__` must be a regular method—not a coroutine method—and it must return an _asynchronous iterator_.

An asynchronous iterator provides an `__anext__` coroutine method that returns an awaitable—often a coroutine object. They are also expected to implement `__aiter__`, which usually returns `self`. This mirrors the important distinction of iterables and iterators we discussed in [“Don’t Make the Iterable an Iterator for Itself”](ch17.html#iterable_not_self_iterator_sec).

The _aiopg_ asynchronous PostgreSQL driver [documentation](https://fpy.li/21-43) has an example that illustrates the use of `async for` to iterate over the rows of a database cursor:

```
async
```

In this example the query will return a single row, but in a realistic scenario you may have thousands of rows in response to a `SELECT` query. For large responses, the cursor will not be loaded with all the rows in a single batch. Therefore it is important that `async for row in cur:` does not block the event loop while the cursor may be waiting for additional rows. By implementing the cursor as an asynchronous iterator, _aiopg_ may yield to the event loop at each `__anext__` call, and resume later when more rows arrive from PostgreSQL.
