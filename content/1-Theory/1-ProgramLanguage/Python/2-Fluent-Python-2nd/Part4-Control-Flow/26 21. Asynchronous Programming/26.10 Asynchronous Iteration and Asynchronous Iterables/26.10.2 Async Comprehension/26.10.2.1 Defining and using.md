### Defining and using an asynchronous generator expression

Given the `multi_probe` asynchronous generator from [Example 21-18](#domainlib_ex), we could write another asynchronous generator returning only the names of the domains found. Here is how—again using the asynchronous console launched with `-m asyncio`:

```
>>> 
```

[![^1]

The use of `async for` makes this an asynchronous generator expression. It can be defined anywhere in a Python module.

[![^2]

The asynchronous generator expression builds an `async_generator` object—exactly the same type of object returned by an asynchronous generator function like `multi_probe`.

[![^3]

The asynchronous generator object is driven by the `async for` statement, which in turn can only appear inside an `async def` body or in the magic asynchronous console I used in this example.

To summarize: an asynchronous generator expression can be defined anywhere in your program, but it can only be consumed inside a native coroutine or asynchronous generator function.

The remaining constructs introduced by PEP 530 can only be defined and used inside native coroutines or asynchronous generator functions.
