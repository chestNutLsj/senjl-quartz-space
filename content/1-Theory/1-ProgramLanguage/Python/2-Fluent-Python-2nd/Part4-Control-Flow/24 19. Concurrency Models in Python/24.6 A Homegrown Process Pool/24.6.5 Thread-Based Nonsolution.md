## Thread-Based Nonsolution

I also wrote _threads.py_, a version of _procs.py_ using `threading` instead of `multiprocessing`. The code is very similar—as is usually the case when converting simple examples between these two APIs.[^16]

The next two chapters will cover more about concurrent programming in Python, using the high-level _concurrent.futures_ library to manage threads and processes ([Chapter 20](ch20.html#futures_ch)) and the _asyncio_ library for asynchronous programming ([Chapter 21](ch21.html#async_ch)).

The remaining sections in this chapter aim to answer the question:

> Given the limitations discussed so far, how is Python thriving in a multicore world?
