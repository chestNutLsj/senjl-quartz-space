### 2. Answer for threading

The spinner is controlled by a secondary thread, so it continues spinning while the primality test is computed by the main thread.

I did not get this answer right at first: I was expecting the spinner to freeze because I overestimated the impact of the GIL.

In this particular example, the spinner keeps spinning because Python suspends the running thread every 5ms (by default), making the GIL available to other pending threads. Therefore, the main thread running `is_prime` is interrupted every 5ms, allowing the secondary thread to wake up and iterate once through the `for` loop, until it calls the `wait` method of the `done` event, at which time it will release the GIL. The main thread will then grab the GIL, and the `is_prime` computation will proceed for another 5ms.

This does not have a visible impact on the running time of this specific example, because the `spin` function quickly iterates once and releases the GIL as it waits for the `done` event, so there is not much contention for the GIL. The main thread running `is_prime` will have the GIL most of the time.

We got away with a compute-intensive task using threading in this simple experiment because there are only two threads: one hogging the CPU, and the other waking up only 10 times per second to update the spinner.

But if you have two or more threads vying for a lot of CPU time, your program will be slower than sequential code.
