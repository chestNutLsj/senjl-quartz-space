## Quick Quiz

Given what we’ve seen so far, please take the time to consider the following three-part question. One part of the answer is tricky (at least it was for me).

> What would happen to the spinner animation if you made the following changes, assuming that `n = 5_000_111_000_222_021`—that prime which my machine takes 3.3s to verify:
> 
> 1. In _spinner_proc.py_, replace `time.sleep(3)` with a call to `is_prime(n)`?
>     
> 2. In _spinner_thread.py_, replace `time.sleep(3)` with a call to `is_prime(n)`?
>     
> 3. In _spinner_async.py_, replace `await asyncio.sleep(3)` with a call to `is_prime(n)`?
>     

Before you run the code or read on, I recommend figuring out the answers on your own. Then, you may want to copy and modify the _spinner_*.py_ examples as suggested.

Now the answers, from easier to hardest.
