# The Real Impact of the GIL

In the threading code ([Example 19-1](#spinner_thread_top_ex)), you can replace the `time.sleep(3)` call in the `slow` function with an HTTP client request from your favorite library, and the spinner will keep spinning. That’s because a well-designed network library will release the GIL while waiting for the network.

You can also replace the `asyncio.sleep(3)` expression in the `slow` coroutine to `await` for a response from a well-designed asynchronous network library, because such libraries provide coroutines that yield control back to the event loop while waiting for the network. Meanwhile, the spinner will keep spinning.

With CPU-intensive code, the story is different. Consider the function `is_prime` in [Example 19-10](#def_is_prime_ex), which returns `True` if the argument is a prime number, `False` if it’s not.

##### Example 19-10. primes.py: an easy to read primality check, from Python’s [`ProcessPool​Executor` example](https://fpy.li/19-19)

```
def
```

The call `is_prime(5_000_111_000_222_021)` takes about 3.3s on the company laptop I am using now.[^12]
