## Spinner with Threads

The idea of the next few examples is simple: start a function that blocks for 3 seconds while animating characters in the terminal to let the user know that the program is “thinking” and not stalled.

The script makes an animated spinner displaying each character in the string `"\|/-"` in the same screen position.[^9] When the slow computation finishes, the line with the spinner is cleared and the result is shown: `Answer: 42`.

[Figure 19-1](#spinner_fig) shows the output of two versions of the spinning example: first with threads, then with coroutines. If you’re away from the computer, imagine the `\` in the last line is spinning.

###### Figure 19-1. The scripts spinner_thread.py and spinner_async.py produce similar output: the repr of a spinner object and the text “Answer: 42”. In the screenshot, spinner_async.py is still running, and the animated message “/ thinking!” is shown; that line will be replaced by “Answer: 42” after 3 seconds.

Let’s review the _spinner_thread.py_ script first. [Example 19-1](#spinner_thread_top_ex) lists the first two functions in the script, and [Example 19-2](#spinner_thread_rest_ex) shows the rest.

##### Example 19-1. spinner_thread.py: the `spin` and `slow` functions

```
import
```

[![^1]

This function will run in a separate thread. The `done` argument is an instance of `threading.Event`, a simple object to synchronize threads.

[![^2]

This is an infinite loop because `itertools.cycle` yields one character at a time, cycling through the string forever.

[![^3]

The trick for text-mode animation: move the cursor back to the start of the line with the carriage return ASCII control character (`'\r'`).

[![^4]

The `Event.wait(timeout=None)` method returns `True` when the event is set by another thread; if the `timeout` elapses, it returns `False`. The .1s timeout sets the “frame rate” of the animation to 10 FPS. If you want the spinner to go faster, use a smaller timeout.

[![^5]

Exit the infinite loop.

[![^6]

Clear the status line by overwriting with spaces and moving the cursor back to the beginning.

[![^7]

`slow()` will be called by the main thread. Imagine this is a slow API call over the network. Calling `sleep` blocks the main thread, but the GIL is released so the spinner thread can proceed.

###### Tip

The first important insight of this example is that `time.sleep()` blocks the calling thread but releases the GIL, allowing other Python threads to run.

The `spin` and `slow` functions will execute concurrently. The main thread—the only thread when the program starts—will start a new thread to run `spin` and then call `slow`. By design, there is no API for terminating a thread in Python. You must send it a message to shut down.

The `threading.Event` class is Python’s simplest signalling mechanism to coordinate threads. An `Event` instance has an internal boolean flag that starts as `False`. Calling `Event.set()` sets the flag to `True`. While the flag is false, if a thread calls `Event.wait()`, it is blocked until another thread calls `Event.set()`, at which time `Event.wait()` returns `True`. If a timeout in seconds is given to `Event.wait(s)`, this call returns `False` when the timeout elapses, or returns `True` as soon as `Event.set()` is called by another thread.

The `supervisor` function, listed in [Example 19-2](#spinner_thread_rest_ex), uses an `Event` to signal the `spin` function to exit.

##### Example 19-2. spinner_thread.py: the `supervisor` and `main` functions

```
def
```

[![^1]

`supervisor` will return the result of `slow`.

[![^2]

The `threading.Event` instance is the key to coordinate the activities of the `main` thread and the `spinner` thread, as explained further down.

[![^3]

To create a new `Thread`, provide a function as the `target` keyword argument, and positional arguments to the `target` as a tuple passed via `args`.

[![^4]

Display the `spinner` object. The output is `<Thread(Thread-1, initial)>`, where `initial` is the state of the thread—meaning it has not started.

[![^5]

Start the `spinner` thread.

[![^6]

Call `slow`, which blocks the `main` thread. Meanwhile, the secondary thread is running the spinner animation.

[![^7]

Set the `Event` flag to `True`; this will terminate the `for` loop inside the `spin` function.

[![^8]

Wait until the `spinner` thread finishes.

[![^9]

Run the `supervisor` function. I wrote separate `main` and `supervisor` functions to make this example look more like the `asyncio` version in [Example 19-4](#spinner_async_start_ex).

When the `main` thread sets the `done` event, the `spinner` thread will eventually notice and exit cleanly.

Now let’s take a look at a similar example using the `multiprocessing` package.
