# What’s New in This Chapter

This chapter is new in the second edition of _Fluent Python_. The spinner examples in [“A Concurrent Hello World”](#concurrent_hello_world) previously were in the chapter about _asyncio_. Here they are improved, and provide the first illustration of Python’s three approaches to concurrency: threads, processes, and native coroutines.

The remaining content is new, except for a few paragraphs that originally appeared in the chapters on `concurrent.futures` and _asyncio_.

[“Python in the Multicore World”](#py_in_multicore_world_sec) is different from the rest of the book: there are no code examples. The goal is to mention important tools that you may want to study to achieve high-performance concurrency and parallelism beyond what’s possible with Python’s standard library.
