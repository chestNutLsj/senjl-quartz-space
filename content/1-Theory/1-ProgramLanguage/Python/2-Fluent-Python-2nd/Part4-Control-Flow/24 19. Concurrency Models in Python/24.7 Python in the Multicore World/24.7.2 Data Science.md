## Data Science

Data science—including artificial intelligence—and scientific computing are very well served by Python. Applications in these fields are compute-intensive, but Python users benefit from a vast ecosystem of numeric computing libraries written in C, C++, Fortran, Cython, etc.—many of which are able to leverage multicore machines, GPUs, and/or distributed parallel computing in heterogeneous clusters.

As of 2021, Python’s data science ecosystem includes impressive tools such as:

[Project Jupyter](https://fpy.li/19-34)

Two browser-based interfaces—Jupyter Notebook and JupyterLab—that allow users to run and document analytics code potentially running across the network on remote machines. Both are hybrid Python/JavaScript applications, supporting computing kernels written in different languages, all integrated via ZeroMQ—an asynchronous messaging library for distributed applications. The name _Jupyter_ actually comes from Julia, Python, and R, the first three languages supported by the Notebook. The rich ecosystem built on top of the Jupyter tools include [Bokeh](https://fpy.li/19-35), a powerful interactive visualization library that lets users navigate and interact with large datasets or continuously updated streaming data, thanks to the performance of modern JavaScript engines and browsers.

[TensorFlow](https://fpy.li/19-36) and [PyTorch](https://fpy.li/19-37)

These are the top two deep learning frameworks, according to [O’Reilly’s January 2021 report](https://fpy.li/19-38) on usage of their learning resources during 2020. Both projects are written in C++, and are able to leverage multiple cores, GPUs, and clusters. They support other languages as well, but Python is their main focus and is used by the majority of their users. TensorFlow was created and is used internally by Google; PyTorch by Facebook.

[Dask](https://fpy.li/dask)

A parallel computing library that can farm out work to local processes or clusters of machines, “tested on some of the largest supercomputers in the world”—as their [home page](https://fpy.li/dask) states. Dask offers APIs that closely emulate NumPy, pandas, and scikit-learn—the most popular libraries in data science and machine learning today. Dask can be used from JupyterLab or Jupyter Notebook, and leverages Bokeh not only for data visualization but also for an interactive dashboard showing the flow of data and computations across the processes/machines in near real time. Dask is so impressive that I recommend watching a video such as this [15-minute demo](https://fpy.li/19-39) in which Matthew Rocklin—a maintainer of the project—shows Dask crunching data on 64 cores distributed in 8 EC2 machines on AWS.

These are only some examples to illustrate how the data science community is creating solutions that leverage the best of Python and overcome the limitations of the CPython runtime.
