## WSGI Application Servers

WSGI—the [Web Server Gateway Interface](https://fpy.li/pep3333)—is a standard API for a Python framework or application to receive requests from an HTTP server and send responses to it.[^23] WSGI application servers manage one or more processes running your application, maximizing the use of the available CPUs.

[Figure 19-4](#app_server_fig) illustrates a typical WSGI deployment.

###### Tip

If we wanted to merge the previous pair of diagrams, the content of the dashed rectangle in [Figure 19-4](#app_server_fig) would replace the solid “Application code” rectangle at the top of [Figure 19-3](#one_possible_architecture_fig).

The best-known application servers in Python web projects are:

- [_mod_wsgi_](https://fpy.li/19-41)
    
- [_uWSGI_](https://fpy.li/19-42)[^24]
    
- [_Gunicorn_](https://fpy.li/gunicorn)
    
- [_NGINX Unit_](https://fpy.li/19-43)
    

For users of the Apache HTTP server, _mod_wsgi_ is the best option. It’s as old as WSGI itself, but is actively maintained, and now provides a command-line launcher called `mod_wsgi-express` that makes it easier to configure and more suitable for use in Docker containers.

###### Figure 19-4. Clients connect to an HTTP server that delivers static files and routes other requests to the application server, which forks child processes to run the application code, leveraging multiple CPU cores. The WSGI API is the glue between the application server and the Python application code.

_uWSGI_ and _Gunicorn_ are the top choices in recent projects I know about. Both are often used with the _NGINX_ HTTP server. _uWSGI_ offers a lot of extra functionality, including an application cache, a task queue, cron-like periodic tasks, and many other features. On the flip side, _uWSGI_ is much harder to configure properly than _Gunicorn_.[^25]

Released in 2018, _NGINX Unit_ is a new product from the makers of the well-known _NGINX_ HTTP server and reverse proxy.

_mod_wsgi_ and _Gunicorn_ support Python web apps only, while _uWSGI_ and _NGINX Unit_ work with other languages as well. Please browse their docs to learn more.

The main point: all of these application servers can potentially use all CPU cores on the server by forking multiple Python processes to run traditional web apps written in good old sequential code in _Django_, _Flask_, _Pyramid_, etc. This explains why it’s been possible to earn a living as a Python web developer without ever studying the `threading`, `multiprocessing`, or `asyncio` modules: the application server handles concurrency transparently.

# ASGI—Asynchronous Server Gateway Interface

WSGI is a synchronous API. It doesn’t support coroutines with `async/await`—the most efficient way to implement WebSockets or HTTP long polling in Python. The [ASGI specification](https://fpy.li/19-46) is a successor to WSGI, designed for asynchronous Python web frameworks such as _aiohttp_, _Sanic_, _FastAPI_, etc., as well as _Django_ and _Flask_, which are gradually adding asynchronous functionality.

Now let’s turn to another way of bypassing the GIL to achieve higher performance with server-side Python applications.
