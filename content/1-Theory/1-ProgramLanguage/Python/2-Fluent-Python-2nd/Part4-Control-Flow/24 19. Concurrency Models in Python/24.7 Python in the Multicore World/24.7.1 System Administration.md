## System Administration

Python is widely used to manage large fleets of servers, routers, load balancers, and network-attached storage (NAS). It’s also a leading option in software-defined networking (SDN) and ethical hacking. Major cloud service providers support Python through libraries and tutorials authored by the providers themselves or by their large communities of Python users.

In this domain, Python scripts automate configuration tasks by issuing commands to be carried out by the remote machines, so rarely there are CPU-bound operations to be done. Threads or coroutines are well suited for such jobs. In particular, the `concurrent.futures` package we’ll see in [Chapter 20](ch20.html#futures_ch) can be used to perform the same operations on many remote machines at the same time without a lot of complexity.

Beyond the standard library, there are popular Python-based projects to manage server clusters: tools like [_Ansible_](https://fpy.li/19-30) and [_Salt_](https://fpy.li/19-31), as well as libraries like [_Fabric_](https://fpy.li/19-32).

There is also a growing number of libraries for system administration supporting coroutines and `asyncio`. In 2016, Facebook’s [Production Engineering team reported](https://fpy.li/19-33): “We are increasingly relying on AsyncIO, which was introduced in Python 3.4, and seeing huge performance gains as we move codebases away from Python 2.”
