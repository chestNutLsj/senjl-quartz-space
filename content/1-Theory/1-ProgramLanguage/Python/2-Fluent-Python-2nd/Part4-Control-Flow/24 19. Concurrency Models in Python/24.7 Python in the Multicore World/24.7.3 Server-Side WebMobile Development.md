## Server-Side Web/Mobile Development

Python is widely used in web applications and for the backend APIs supporting mobile applications. How is it that Google, YouTube, Dropbox, Instagram, Quora, and Reddit—among others—managed to build Python server-side applications serving hundreds of millions of users 24x7? Again, the answer goes way beyond what Python provides “out of the box.”

Before we discuss tools to support Python at scale, I must quote an admonition from the Thoughtworks _Technology Radar_:

> **High performance envy/web scale envy**
> 
> We see many teams run into trouble because they have chosen complex tools, frameworks or architectures because they “might need to scale.” Companies such as Twitter and Netflix need to support extreme loads and so need these architectures, but they also have extremely skilled development teams able to handle the complexity. Most situations do not require these kinds of engineering feats; teams should keep their _web scale envy_ in check in favor of simpler solutions that still get the job done.[^20]

At _web scale_, the key is an architecture that allows horizontal scaling. At that point, all systems are distributed systems, and no single programming language is likely to be the right choice for every part of the solution.

Distributed systems is a field of academic research, but fortunately some practitioners have written accessible books anchored on solid research and practical experience. One of them is Martin Kleppmann, the author of _Designing Data-Intensive Applications_ (O’Reilly).

Consider [Figure 19-3](#one_possible_architecture_fig), the first of many architecture diagrams in Kleppmann’s book. Here are some components I’ve seen in Python engagements that I worked on or have firsthand knowledge of:

- Application caches:[^21] _memcached_, _Redis_, _Varnish_
    
- Relational databases: _PostgreSQL_, _MySQL_
    
- Document databases: _Apache CouchDB_, _MongoDB_
    
- Full-text indexes: _Elasticsearch_, _Apache Solr_
    
- Message queues: _RabbitMQ_, _Redis_

There are other industrial-strength open source products in each of those categories. Major cloud providers also offer their own proprietary alternatives.

Kleppmann’s diagram is general and language independent—as is his book. For Python server-side applications, two specific components are often deployed:

- An application server to distribute the load among several instances of the Python application. The application server would appear near the top in [Figure 19-3](#one_possible_architecture_fig), handling client requests before they reached the application code.
    
- A task queue built around the message queue on the righthand side of [Figure 19-3](#one_possible_architecture_fig), providing a higher-level, easier-to-use API to distribute tasks to processes running on other machines.
    

The next two sections explore these components that are recommended best practices in Python server-side deployments.
