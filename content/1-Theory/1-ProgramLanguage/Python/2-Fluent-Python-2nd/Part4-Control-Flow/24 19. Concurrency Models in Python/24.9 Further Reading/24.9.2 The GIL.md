## The GIL

If you are intrigued about the GIL, remember we have no control over it from Python code, so the canonical reference is in the C-API documentation: [_Thread State and the Global Interpreter Lock_](https://fpy.li/19-60). The _Python Library and Extension FAQ_ answers: [_“Can’t we get rid of the Global Interpreter Lock?”_](https://fpy.li/19-61). Also worth reading are posts by Guido van Rossum and Jesse Noller (contributor of the `multiprocessing` package), respectively: [“It isn’t Easy to Remove the GIL”](https://fpy.li/19-62) and [“Python Threads and the Global Interpreter Lock”](https://fpy.li/19-63).

[_CPython Internals_](https://fpy.li/19-64) by Anthony Shaw (Real Python) explains the implementation of the CPython 3 interpreter at the C programming level. Shaw’s longest chapter is “Parallelism and Concurrency”: a deep dive into Python’s native support for threads and processes, including managing the GIL from extensions using the C/Python API.

Finally, David Beazley presented a detailed exploration in [“Understanding the Python GIL”](https://fpy.li/19-65).[^27].
