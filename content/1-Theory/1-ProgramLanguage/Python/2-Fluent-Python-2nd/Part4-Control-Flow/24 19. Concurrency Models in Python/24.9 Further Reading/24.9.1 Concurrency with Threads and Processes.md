## Concurrency with Threads and Processes

The _concurrent.futures_ library covered in [Chapter 20](ch20.html#futures_ch) uses threads, processes, locks, and queues under the hood, but you won’t see individual instances of them; they’re bundled and managed by the higher-level abstractions of a `ThreadPoolExecutor` and a `ProcessPoolExecutor`. If you want to learn more about the practice of concurrent programming with those low-level objects, [“An Intro to Threading in Python”](https://fpy.li/19-51) by Jim Anderson is a good first read. Doug Hellmann has a chapter titled “Concurrency with Processes, Threads, and Coroutines” on his [website](https://fpy.li/19-52) and book, [_The Python 3 Standard Library by Example_](https://fpy.li/19-53) (Addison-Wesley).

Brett Slatkin’s [_Effective Python_](https://fpy.li/effectpy), 2nd ed. (Addison-Wesley), David Beazley’s _Python Essential Reference_, 4th ed. (Addison-Wesley), and Martelli et al., _Python in a Nutshell_, 3rd ed. (O’Reilly) are other general Python references with significant coverage of `threading` and `multiprocessing`. The vast `multiprocessing` official documentation includes useful advice in its [“Programming guidelines” section](https://fpy.li/19-54).

Jesse Noller and Richard Oudkerk contributed the `multiprocessing` package, introduced in [PEP 371—Addition of the multiprocessing package to the standard library](https://fpy.li/pep371). The official documentation for the package is a [93 KB _.rst_ file](https://fpy.li/19-55)—that’s about 63 pages—making it one of the longest chapters in the Python standard library.

In [_High Performance Python_, 2nd ed.,](https://fpy.li/19-56) (O’Reilly), authors Micha Gorelick and Ian Ozsvald include a chapter about `multiprocessing` with an example about checking for primes with a different strategy than our _procs.py_ example. For each number, they split the range of possible factors—from 2 to `sqrt(n)`—into subranges, and make each worker iterate over one of the subranges. Their divide-and-conquer approach is typical of scientific computing applications where the datasets are huge, and workstations (or clusters) have more CPU cores than users. On a server-side system handling requests from many users, it is simpler and more efficient to let each process work on one computation from start to finish—reducing the overhead of communication and coordination among processes. Besides `multiprocessing`, Gorelick and Ozsvald present many other ways of developing and deploying high-performance data science applications leveraging multiple cores, GPUs, clusters, profilers, and compilers like Cython and Numba. Their last chapter, “Lessons from the Field,” is a valuable collection of short case studies contributed by other practitioners of high-performance computing in Python.

[_Advanced Python Development_](https://fpy.li/19-57) by Matthew Wilkes (Apress), is a rare book that includes short examples to explain concepts, while also showing how to build a realistic application ready for production: a data aggregator, similar to DevOps monitoring systems or IoT data collectors for distributed sensors. Two chapters in _Advanced Python Development_ cover concurrent programming with `threading` and `asyncio`.

Jan Palach’s [_Parallel Programming with Python_](https://fpy.li/19-58) (Packt, 2014) explains the core concepts behind concurrency and parallelism, covering Python’s standard library as well as _Celery_.

“The Truth About Threads” is the title of Chapter 2 in [_Using Asyncio in Python_](https://fpy.li/hattingh) by Caleb Hattingh (O’Reilly).[^26] The chapter covers the benefits and drawbacks of threading—with compelling quotes from several authoritative sources—making it clear that the fundamental challenges of threads have nothing to do with Python or the GIL. Quoting verbatim from page 14 of _Using Asyncio in Python_:

> These themes repeat throughout:
> 
> - Threading makes code hard to reason about.
>     
> - Threading is an inefficient model for large-scale concurrency (thousands of concurrent tasks).
>     

If you want to learn the hard way how difficult it is to reason about threads and locks—without risking your job—try the exercises in Allen Downey’s workbook, [_The Little Book of Semaphores_](https://fpy.li/19-59) (Green Tea Press). The exercises in Downey’s book range from easy to very hard to unsolvable, but even the easy ones are eye-opening.
