## Sentence Take #3: A Generator Function

A Pythonic implementation of the same functionality uses a generator, avoiding all the work to implement the `SentenceIterator` class. A proper explanation of the generator comes right after [Example 17-5](#ex_sentence2).

##### Example 17-5. sentence_gen.py: `Sentence` implemented using a generator

```
import
```

[![^1]

Iterate over `self.words`.

[![^2]

Yield the current `word`.

[![^3]

Explicit `return` is not necessary; the function can just “fall through” and return automatically. Either way, a generator function doesn’t raise `StopIteration`: it simply exits when it’s done producing values.[^4]

[![^4]

No need for a separate iterator class!

Here again we have a different implementation of `Sentence` that passes the tests in [Example 17-2](#demo_sentence0).

Back in the `Sentence` code in [Example 17-4](#ex_sentence1), `__iter__` called the `SentenceIterator` constructor to build an iterator and return it. Now the iterator in [Example 17-5](#ex_sentence2) is in fact a generator object, built automatically when the `__iter__` method is called, because `__iter__` here is a generator function.

A full explanation of generators follows.
