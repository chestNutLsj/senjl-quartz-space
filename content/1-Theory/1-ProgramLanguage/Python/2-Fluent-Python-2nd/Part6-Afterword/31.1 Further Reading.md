# Further Reading

I will wrap up the book with references regarding what it its to be “Pythonic”—the main question this book tried to address.

Brandon Rhodes is an awesome Python teacher, and his talk [“A Python Æsthetic: Beauty and Why I Python”](https://fpy.li/a-3) is beautiful, starting with the use of Unicode U+00C6 (`LATIN CAPITAL LETTER AE`) in the title. Another awesome teacher, Raymond Hettinger, spoke of beauty in Python at PyCon US 2013: [“Transforming Code into Beautiful, Idiomatic Python”](https://fpy.li/a-4).

The [“Evolution of Style Guides” thread](https://fpy.li/a-5) that Ian Lee started on Python-ideas is worth reading. Lee is the maintainer of the [`pep8`](https://fpy.li/a-6) package that checks Python source code for PEP 8 compliance. To check the code in this book, I used [`flake8`](https://fpy.li/a-7), which wraps `pep8`, [`pyflakes`](https://fpy.li/a-8), and Ned Batchelder’s [McCabe complexity plug-in](https://fpy.li/a-9).

Besides PEP 8, other influential style guides are the [_Google Python Style Guide_](https://fpy.li/a-10) and the [_Pocoo Styleguide_](https://fpy.li/a-11), from the team that brought us Flake, Sphinx, Jinja 2, and other great Python libraries.

[_The Hitchhiker’s Guide to Python!_](https://fpy.li/a-12) is a collective work about writing Pythonic code. Its most prolific contributor is Kenneth Reitz, a community hero thanks to his beautifully Pythonic `requests` package. David Goodger presented a tutorial at PyCon US 2008 titled [“Code Like a Pythonista: Idiomatic Python”](https://fpy.li/a-13). If printed, the tutorial notes are 30 pages long. Goodger created both reStructuredText and `docutils`—the foundations of Sphinx, Python’s excellent documentation system (which, by the way, is also the [official documentation system](https://fpy.li/a-14) for MongoDB and many other projects).

Martijn Faassen tackles the question head-on in [“What is Pythonic?”](https://fpy.li/a-15) In the python-list, there is a thread with [that same title](https://fpy.li/a-16). Martijn’s post is from 2005, and the thread from 2003, but the Pythonic ideal hasn’t changed much—neither has the language, for that matter. A great thread with “Pythonic” in the title is [“Pythonic way to sum n-th list element?”](https://fpy.li/a-17), from which I quoted extensively in the [“Soapbox”](ch12.html#sequence_hacking_soapbox).

[PEP 3099 — Things that will Not Change in Python 3000](https://fpy.li/pep3099) explains why many things are the way they are, even after the major overhaul that was Python 3. For a long time, Python 3 was nicknamed Python 3000, but it arrived a few centuries sooner—to the dismay of some. PEP 3099 was written by Georg Brandl, compiling many opinions expressed by the _BDFL_, Guido van Rossum. The [“Python Essays”](https://fpy.li/a-18) page lists several texts by Guido himself.
