# Typed Named Tuples

The `Coordinate` class with a default field from [Example 5-6](#ex_coord_tuple_default) can be written using `typing.NamedTuple`, as shown in [Example 5-8](#coord_tuple_default_ex).

[![^1]

Every instance field must be annotated with a type.

[![^2]

The `reference` instance field is annotated with a type and a default value.

Classes built by `typing.NamedTuple` don’t have any methods beyond those that `collections.namedtuple` also generates—and those that are inherited from `tuple`. The only difference is the presence of the `__annotations__` class attribute—which Python completely ignores at runtime.

Given that the main feature of `typing.NamedTuple` are the type annotations, we’ll take a brief look at them before resuming our exploration of data class builders.
