## Simple Class Patterns

We’ve already seen an example with simple class patterns used as subpatterns in [“Pattern Matching with Sequences”](ch02.html#sequence_patterns_sec):

        `case` `[``str``(``name``),` `_``,` `_``,` `(``float``(``lat``),` `float``(``lon``))]:`

That pattern matches a four-item sequence where the first item must be an instance of `str`, and the last item must be a 2-tuple with two instances of `float`.

The syntax for class patterns looks like a constructor invocation. The following is a class pattern that matches `float` values without binding a variable (the case body can refer to `x` directly if needed):

    `match` `x``:`
        `case` `float``():`
            `do_something_with``(``x``)`

But this is likely to be a bug in your code:

    `match` `x``:`
        `case` `float``:`  `# DANGER!!!`
            `do_something_with``(``x``)`

In the preceding example, `case float:` matches any subject, because Python sees `float` as a variable, which is then bound to the subject.

The simple pattern syntax of `float(x)` is a special case that applies only to nine blessed built-in types, listed at the end of the [“Class Patterns”](https://fpy.li/5-16) section of [PEP 634—Structural Pattern Matching: Specification](https://fpy.li/pep634):

bytes   dict   float   frozenset   int   list   set   str   tuple

In those classes, the variable that looks like a constructor argument—e.g., the `x` in `float(x)`—is bound to the whole subject instance or the part of the subject that matches a subpattern, as exemplified by `str(name)` in the sequence pattern we saw earlier:

        `case` `[``str``(``name``),` `_``,` `_``,` `(``float``(``lat``),` `float``(``lon``))]:`

If the class is not one of those nine blessed built-ins, then the argument-like variables represent patterns to be matched against attributes of an instance of that class.
