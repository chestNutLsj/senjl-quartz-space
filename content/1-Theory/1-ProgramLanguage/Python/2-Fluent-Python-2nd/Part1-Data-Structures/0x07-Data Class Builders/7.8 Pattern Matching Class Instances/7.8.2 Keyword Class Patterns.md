## Keyword Class Patterns

To understand how to use keyword class patterns, consider the following `City` class and five instances in [Example 5-22](#ex_cities_match).

##### Example 5-22. `City` class and a few instances

```
import
```

Given those definitions, the following function would return a list of Asian cities:

```
def
```

The pattern `City(continent='Asia')` matches any `City` instance where the `continent` attribute value is equal to `'Asia'`, regardless of the values of the other attributes.

If you want to collect the value of the `country` attribute, you could write:

```
def
```

The pattern `City(continent='Asia', country=cc)` matches the same Asian cities as before, but now the `cc` variable is bound to the `country` attribute of the instance. This also works if the pattern variable is called `country` as well:

        `match` `city``:`
            `case` `City``(``continent``=``'Asia'``,` `country``=``country``):`
                `results``.``append``(``country``)`

Keyword class patterns are very readable, and work with any class that has public instance attributes, but they are somewhat verbose.

Positional class patterns are more convenient in some cases, but they require explicit support by the class of the subject, as we’ll see next.
