# Type Hints 101

Type hints—a.k.a. type annotations—are ways to declare the expected type of function arguments, return values, variables, and attributes.

The first thing you need to know about type hints is that they are not enforced at all by the Python bytecode compiler and interpreter.

###### Note

This is a very brief introduction to type hints, just enough to make sense of the syntax and meaning of the annotations used in `typing.NamedTuple` and `@dataclass` declarations. We will cover type hints for function signatures in [Chapter 8](ch08.html#type_hints_in_def_ch) and more advanced annotations in [Chapter 15](ch15.html#more_types_ch). Here we’ll mostly see hints with simple built-in types, such as `str`, `int`, and `float`, which are probably the most common types used to annotate fields of data classes.
