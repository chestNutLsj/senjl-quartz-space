# Further Reading

Python’s standard documentation for the data class builders we covered is very good, and has quite a few small examples.

For `@dataclass` in particular, most of [PEP 557—Data Classes](https://fpy.li/pep557) was copied into the [`dataclasses`](https://fpy.li/5-9) module documentation. But [PEP 557](https://fpy.li/pep557) has a few very informative sections that were not copied, including [“Why not just use namedtuple?”](https://fpy.li/5-18), [“Why not just use typing.NamedTuple?”](https://fpy.li/5-19), and the [“Rationale” section](https://fpy.li/5-20), which concludes with this Q&A:

> Where is it not appropriate to use Data Classes?
> 
> API compatibility with tuples or dicts is required. Type validation beyond that provided by PEPs 484 and 526 is required, or value validation or conversion is required.
> 
> Eric V. Smith, PEP 557 “Rationale”

Over at [_RealPython.com_](https://fpy.li/5-21), Geir Arne Hjelle wrote a very complete [“Ultimate guide to data classes in Python 3.7”](https://fpy.li/5-22).

At PyCon US 2018, Raymond Hettinger presented [“Dataclasses: The code generator to end all code generators” (video)](https://fpy.li/5-23).

For more features and advanced functionality, including validation, the [_attrs_ project](https://fpy.li/5-24) led by Hynek Schlawack appeared years before `dataclasses`, and offers more features, promising to “bring back the joy of writing classes by relieving you from the drudgery of implementing object protocols (aka dunder methods).” The influence of _attrs_ on `@dataclass` is acknowledged by Eric V. Smith in PEP 557. This probably includes Smith’s most important API decision: the use of a class decorator instead of a base class and/or a metaclass to do the job.

Glyph—founder of the Twisted project—wrote an excellent introduction to _attrs_ in [“The One Python Library Everyone Needs”](https://fpy.li/5-25). The _attrs_ documentation includes a [discussion of alternatives](https://fpy.li/5-26).

Book author, instructor, and mad computer scientist Dave Beazley wrote [_cluegen_](https://fpy.li/5-27), yet another data class generator. If you’ve seen any of Dave’s talks, you know he is a master of metaprogramming Python from first principles. So I found it inspiring to learn from the _cluegen_ _README.md_ file the concrete use case that motivated him to write an alternative to Python’s `@dataclass`, and his philosophy of presenting an approach to solve the problem, in contrast to providing a tool: the tool may be quicker to use at first, but the approach is more flexible and can take you as far as you want to go.

Regarding _data class_ as a code smell, the best source I found was Martin Fowler’s book _Refactoring_, 2nd ed. This newest version is missing the quote from the epigraph of this chapter, “Data classes are like children…,” but otherwise it’s the best edition of Fowler’s most famous book, particularly for Pythonistas because the examples are in modern JavaScript, which is closer to Python than Java—the language of the first edition.

The website [_Refactoring Guru_](https://fpy.li/5-28) also has a description of the [data class code smell](https://fpy.li/5-29).

##### Soapbox

The entry for [“Guido”](https://fpy.li/5-30) in [“The Jargon File”](https://fpy.li/5-31) is about Guido van Rossum. It says, among other things:

> Mythically, Guido’s most important attribute besides Python itself is Guido’s time machine, a device he is reputed to possess because of the unnerving frequency with which user requests for new features have been met with the response “I just implemented that last night…”

For the longest time, one of the missing pieces in Python’s syntax has been a quick, standard way to declare instance attributes in a class. Many object-oriented languages have that. Here is part of a `Point` class definition in Smalltalk:

Object subclass: #Point
    instanceVariableNames: 'x y'
    classVariableNames: ''
    package: 'Kernel-BasicObjects'

The second line lists the names of the instance attributes `x` and `y`. If there were class attributes, they would be in the third line.

Python has always offered an easy way to declare class attributes, if they have an initial value. But instance attributes are much more common, and Python coders have been forced to look into the `__init__` method to find them, always afraid that there may be instance attributes created elsewhere in the class—or even created by external functions or methods of other classes.

Now we have `@dataclass`, yay!

But they bring their own problems.

First, when you use `@dataclass`, type hints are not optional. We’ve been promised for the last seven years, since [PEP 484—Type Hints](https://fpy.li/pep484) that they would always be optional. Now we have a major new language feature that requires them. If you don’t like the whole static typing trend, you may want to use [`attrs`](https://fpy.li/5-24) instead.

Second, the [PEP 526](https://fpy.li/pep526) syntax for annotating instance and class attributes reverses the established convention of `class` statements: everything declared at the top-level of a `class` block was a class attribute (methods are class attributes, too). With PEP 526 and `@dataclass`, any attribute declared at the top level with a type hint becomes an instance attribute:

    `@dataclass`
    `class` `Spam``:`
        `repeat``:` `int`  `# instance attribute`

Here, `repeat` is also an instance attribute:

    `@dataclass`
    `class` `Spam``:`
        `repeat``:` `int` `=` `99`  `# instance attribute`

But if there are no type hints, suddenly you are back in the good old times when declarations at the top level of the class belong to the class only:

    `@dataclass`
    `class` `Spam``:`
        `repeat` `=` `99`  `# class attribute!`

Finally, if you want to annotate that class attribute with a type, you can’t use regular types because then it will become an instance attribute. You must resort to that pseudotype `ClassVar` annotation:

    `@dataclass`
    `class` `Spam``:`
        `repeat``:` `ClassVar``[``int``]` `=` `99`  `# aargh!`

Here we are talking about the exception to the exception to the rule. This seems rather unPythonic to me.

I did not take part in the discussions leading to PEP 526 or [PEP 557—Data Classes](https://fpy.li/pep557), but here is an alternative syntax that I’d like to see:

```
@dataclass
```

[![^1]

Instance attributes must be declared with a `.` prefix.

[![^2]

Any attribute name that doesn’t have a `.` prefix is a class attribute (as they always have been).

The language grammar would have to change to accept that. I find this quite readable, and it avoids the exception-to-the-exception issue.

I wish I could borrow Guido’s time machine to go back to 2017 and sell this idea to the core team.

[^4]:  If you know Ruby, you know that injecting methods is a well-known but controversial technique among Rubyists. In Python, it’s not as common, because it doesn’t work with any built-in type—`str`, `list`, etc. I consider this limitation of Python a blessing.

[^5]:  In the context of type hints, `None` is not the `NoneType` singleton, but an alias for `NoneType` itself. This is strange when we stop to think about it, but appeals to our intuition and makes function return annotations easier to read in the common case of functions that return `None`.
