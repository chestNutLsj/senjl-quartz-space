## Data Class as Scaffolding

In this scenario, the data class is an initial, simplistic implementation of a class to jump-start a new project or module. With time, the class should get its own methods, instead of relying on methods of other classes to operate on its instances. Scaffolding is temporary; eventually your custom class may become fully independent from the builder you used to start it.

Python is also used for quick problem solving and experimentation, and then itâ€™s OK to leave the scaffolding in place.
