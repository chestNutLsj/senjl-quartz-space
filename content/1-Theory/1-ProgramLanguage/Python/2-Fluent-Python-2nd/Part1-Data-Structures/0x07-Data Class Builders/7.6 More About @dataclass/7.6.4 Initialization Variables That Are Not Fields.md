## Initialization Variables That Are Not Fields

Sometimes you may need to pass arguments to `__init__` that are not instance fields. Such arguments are called _init-only variables_ by the [`dataclasses` documentation](https://fpy.li/initvar). To declare an argument like that, the `dataclasses` module provides the pseudotype `InitVar`, which uses the same syntax of `typing.ClassVar`. The example given in the documentation is a data class that has a field initialized from a database, and the database object must be passed to the constructor.

[Example 5-18](#initvar_ex) shows the code that illustrates the [“Init-only variables” section](https://fpy.li/initvar).

##### Example 5-18. Example from the [`dataclasses`](https://fpy.li/initvar) module documentation

```
@dataclass
```

Note how the `database` attribute is declared. `InitVar` will prevent `@dataclass` from treating `database` as a regular field. It will not be set as an instance attribute, and the `dataclasses.fields` function will not list it. However, `database` will be one of the arguments that the generated `__init__` will accept, and it will be also passed to `__post_init__`. If you write that method, you must add a corresponding argument to the method signature, as shown in [Example 5-18](#initvar_ex).

This rather long overview of `@dataclass` covered the most useful features—some of them appeared in previous sections, like [“Main Features”](#dc_main_features_sec) where we covered all three data class builders in parallel. The [`dataclasses` documentation](https://fpy.li/initvar) and [PEP 526—Syntax for Variable Annotations](https://fpy.li/pep526) have all the details.

In the next section, I present a longer example with `@dataclass`.
