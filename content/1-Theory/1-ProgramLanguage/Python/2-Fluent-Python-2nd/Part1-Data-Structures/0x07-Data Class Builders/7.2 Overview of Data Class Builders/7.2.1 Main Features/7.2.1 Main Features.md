## Main Features

The different data class builders have a lot in common, as summarized in [Table 5-1](#builders_compared_tbl).

Table 5-1. Selected features compared across the three data class builders; `x` stands for an instance of a data class of that kind
||namedtuple|NamedTuple|dataclass|
|---|---|---|---|
|mutable instances|NO|NO|YES|
|class statement syntax|NO|YES|YES|
|construct dict|x._asdict()|x._asdict()|dataclasses.asdict(x)|
|get field names|x._fields|x._fields|[f.name for f in dataclasses.fields(x)]|
|get defaults|x._field_defaults|x._field_defaults|[f.default for f in dataclasses.fields(x)]|
|get field types|N/A|x.__annotations__|x.__annotations__|
|new instance with changes|x._replace(…)|x._replace(…)|dataclasses.replace(x, …)|
|new class at runtime|namedtuple(…)|NamedTuple(…)|dataclasses.make_dataclass(…)|

###### Warning

The classes built by `typing.NamedTuple` and `@dataclass` have an `__annotations__` attribute holding the type hints for the fields. However, reading from `__annotations__` directly is not recommended. Instead, the recommended best practice to get that information is to call [`inspect.get_annotations(MyClass)`](https://fpy.li/5-2) (added in Python 3.10) or [`typing.​get_​type_​hints(MyClass)`](https://fpy.li/5-3) (Python 3.5 to 3.9). That’s because those functions provide extra services, like resolving forward references in type hints. We’ll come back to this issue much later in the book, in [“Problems with Annotations at Runtime”](ch15.html#problems_annot_runtime_sec).

Now let’s discuss those main features.
