### Get field names and default values

All three class builders let you get the field names and default values that may be configured for them. In named tuple classes, that metadata is in the `._fields` and `._fields_defaults` class attributes. You can get the same metadata from a `dataclass` decorated class using the `fields` function from the `dataclasses` module. It returns a tuple of `Field` objects that have several attributes, including `name` and `default`.
