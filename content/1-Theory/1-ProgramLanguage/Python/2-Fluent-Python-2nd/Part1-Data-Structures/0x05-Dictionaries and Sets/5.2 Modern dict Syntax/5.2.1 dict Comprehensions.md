## dict Comprehensions

Since Python 2.7, the syntax of listcomps and genexps was adapted to `dict` comprehensions (and `set` comprehensions as well, which we’ll soon visit). A _dictcomp_ (dict comprehension) builds a `dict` instance by taking `key:value` pairs from any iterable. [Example 3-1](#example3-1) shows the use of `dict` comprehensions to build two dictionaries from the same list of tuples.

##### Example 3-1. Examples of `dict` comprehensions

```

[![^1]

An iterable of key-value pairs like `dial_codes` can be passed directly to the `dict` constructor, but…

[![^2]

…here we swap the pairs: `country` is the key, and `code` is the value.

[![^3]

Sorting `country_dial` by name, reversing the pairs again, uppercasing values, and filtering items with `code < 70`.

If you’re used to listcomps, dictcomps are a natural next step. If you aren’t, the spread of the comprehension syntax means it’s now more profitable than ever to become fluent in it.
