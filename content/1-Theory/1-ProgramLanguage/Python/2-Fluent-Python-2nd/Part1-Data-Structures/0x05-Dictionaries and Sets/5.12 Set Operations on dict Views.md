# Set Operations on dict Views

[Table 3-5](#view_methods_tbl) shows that the view objects returned by the `dict` methods `.keys()` and `.items()` are remarkably similar to `frozenset`.

Table 3-5. Methods implemented by `frozenset`, `dict_keys`, and `dict_items`
||frozenset|dict_keys|dict_items|Description|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|`s.__and__(z)`|●|●|●|`s & z` (intersection of `s` and `z`)|
|`s.__rand__(z)`|●|●|●|Reversed `&` operator|
|`s.__contains__()`|●|●|●|`e in s`|
|`s.copy()`|●|||Shallow copy of `s`|
|`s.difference(it, …)`|●|||Difference between `s` and iterables `it`, etc.|
|`s.intersection(it, …)`|●|||Intersection of `s` and iterables `it`, etc.|
|`s.isdisjoint(z)`|●|●|●|`s` and `z` are disjoint (no elements in common)|
|`s.issubset(it)`|●|||`s` is a subset of iterable `it`|
|`s.issuperset(it)`|●|||`s` is a superset of iterable `it`|
|`s.__iter__()`|●|●|●|Get iterator over `s`|
|`s.__len__()`|●|●|●|`len(s)`|
|`s.__or__(z)`|●|●|●|`s \| z` (union of `s` and `z`)|
|`s.__ror__()`|●|●|●|Reversed `\|` operator|
|`s.__reversed__()`||●|●|Get iterator over `s` in reverse order|
|`s.__rsub__(z)`|●|●|●|Reversed `-` operator|
|`s.__sub__(z)`|●|●|●|`s - z` (difference between `s` and `z`)|
|`s.symmetric_difference(it)`|●|||Complement of `s & set(it)`|
|`s.union(it, …)`|●|||Union of `s` and iterables `it`, etc.|
|`s.__xor__()`|●|●|●|`s ^ z` (symmetric difference of `s` and `z`)|
|`s.__rxor__()`|●|●|●|Reversed `^` operator|

In particular, `dict_keys` and `dict_items` implement the special methods to support the powerful set operators `&` (intersection), `|` (union), `-` (difference), and `^` (symmetric difference).

For example, using `&` is easy to get the keys that appear in two dictionaries:

```
>>> 
```

Note that the return value of `&` is a `set`. Even better: the set operators in dictionary views are compatible with `set` instances. Check this out:

```
>>> 
```

###### Warning

A `dict_items` view only works as a set if all values in the `dict` are hashable. Attempting set operations on a `dict_items` view with an unhashable value raises `TypeError: unhashable type 'T'`, with `T` as the type of the offending value.

On the other hand, a `dict_keys` view can always be used as a set, because every key is hashable—by definition.

Using set operators with views will save a lot of loops and ifs when inspecting the contents of dictionaries in your code. Let Python’s efficient implementation in C work for you!

With this, we can wrap up this chapter.
