## Set Operations

[Figure 3-2](#set_uml) gives an overview of the methods you can use on mutable and immutable sets. Many of them are special methods that overload operators, such as `&` and `>=`. [Table 3-2](#set_operators_tbl) shows the math set operators that have corresponding operators or methods in Python. Note that some operators and methods perform in-place changes on the target set (e.g., `&=`, `difference_update`, etc.). Such operations make no sense in the ideal world of mathematical sets, and are not implemented in `frozenset`.

###### Tip

The infix operators in [Table 3-2](#set_operators_tbl) require that both operands be sets, but all other methods take one or more iterable arguments. For example, to produce the union of four collections, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d`, you can call `a.union(b, c, d)`, where `a` must be a `set`, but `b`, `c`, and `d` can be iterables of any type that produce hashable items. If you need to create a new set with the union of four iterables, instead of updating an existing set, you can write `{*a, *b, *c, *d}` since Python 3.5 thanks to [PEP 448—Additional Unpacking Generalizations](https://fpy.li/pep448).

In addition to the operators and methods derived from math set theory, the set types implement other methods of practical use, summarized in [Table 3-4](#set_methods_tbl).

Table 3-4. Additional set methods
||set|frozenset||
|---|---|---|---|
|`s.add(e)`|●||Add element `e` to `s`|
|`s.clear()`|●||Remove all elements of `s`|
|`s.copy()`|●|●|Shallow copy of `s`|
|`s.discard(e)`|●||Remove element `e` from `s` if it is present|
|`s.__iter__()`|●|●|Get iterator over `s`|
|`s.__len__()`|●|●|`len(s)`|
|`s.pop()`|●||Remove and return an element from `s`, raising `KeyError` if `s` is empty|
|`s.remove(e)`|●||Remove element `e` from `s`, raising `KeyError` if `e not in s`|

This completes our overview of the features of sets. As promised in [“Dictionary Views”](#dictionary_views_sec), we’ll now see how two of the dictionary view types behave very much like a `frozenset`.
