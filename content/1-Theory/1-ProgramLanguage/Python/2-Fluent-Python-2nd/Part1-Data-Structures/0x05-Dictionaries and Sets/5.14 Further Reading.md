In The Python Standard Library documentation, [“collections—Container datatypes”](https://fpy.li/collec), includes examples and practical recipes with several mapping types. The Python source code for the module _Lib/collections/__init__.py_ is a great reference for anyone who wants to create a new mapping type or grok the logic of the existing ones. Chapter 1 of the [_Python Cookbook_, 3rd ed.](https://fpy.li/pycook3) (O’Reilly) by David Beazley and Brian K. Jones has 20 handy and insightful recipes with data structures—the majority using `dict` in clever ways.

Greg Gandenberger advocates for the continued use of `collections.OrderedDict`, on the grounds that “explicit is better than implicit,” backward compatibility, and the fact that some tools and libraries assume the ordering of `dict` keys is irrelevant—his post: [“Python Dictionaries Are Now Ordered. Keep Using OrderedDict”](https://fpy.li/3-18).

[PEP 3106—Revamping dict.keys(), .values() and .items()](https://fpy.li/pep3106) is where Guido van Rossum presented the dictionary views feature for Python 3. In the abstract, he wrote that the idea came from the Java Collections Framework.

[PyPy](https://fpy.li/3-19) was the first Python interpreter to implement Raymond Hettinger’s proposal of compact dicts, and they blogged about it in [“Faster, more memory efficient and more ordered dictionaries on PyPy”](https://fpy.li/3-20), acknowledging that a similar layout was adopted in PHP 7, described in [PHP’s new hashtable implementation](https://fpy.li/3-21). It’s always great when creators cite prior art.

At PyCon 2017, Brandon Rhodes presented [“The Dictionary Even Mightier”](https://fpy.li/3-22), a sequel to his classic animated presentation [“The Mighty Dictionary”](https://fpy.li/3-23)—including animated hash collisions! Another up-to-date, but more in-depth video on the internals of Python’s `dict` is [“Modern Dictionaries”](https://fpy.li/3-24) by Raymond Hettinger, where he tells that after initially failing to sell compact dicts to the CPython core devs, he lobbied the PyPy team, they adopted it, the idea gained traction, and was finally [contributed](https://fpy.li/3-25) to CPython 3.6 by INADA Naoki. For all details, check out the extensive comments in the CPython code for [_Objects/dictobject.c_](https://fpy.li/3-26) and the design document [_Objects/dictnotes.txt_](https://fpy.li/3-27).

The rationale for adding sets to Python is documented in [PEP 218—Adding a Built-In Set Object Type](https://fpy.li/pep218). When PEP 218 was approved, no special literal syntax was adopted for sets. The `set` literals were created for Python 3 and backported to Python 2.7, along with `dict` and `set` comprehensions. At PyCon 2019, I presented [“Set Practice: learning from Python’s set types”](https://fpy.li/3-29) describing use cases of sets in real programs, covering their API design, and the implementation of [`uintset`](https://fpy.li/3-30), a set class for integer elements using a bit vector instead of a hash table, inspired by an example in Chapter 6 of the excellent [_The Go Programming Language_](http://gopl.io), by Alan Donovan and Brian Kernighan (Addison-Wesley).

IEEE’s _Spectrum_ magazine has a story about Hans Peter Luhn, a prolific inventor who patented a punched card deck to select cocktail recipes depending on ingredients available, among other diverse inventions including…hash tables! See [“Hans Peter Luhn and the Birth of the Hashing Algorithm”](https://fpy.li/3-31).

Syntactic Sugar

My friend Geraldo Cohen once remarked that Python is “simple and correct.”

Programming language purists like to dismiss syntax as unimportant.

Syntax is the user interface of a programming language, so it does matter in practice.

Before finding Python, I did some web programming using Perl and PHP. The syntax for mappings in these languages is very useful, and I badly miss it whenever I have to use Java or C.

A good literal syntax for mappings is very convenient for configuration, table-driven implementations, and to hold data for prototyping and testing. That’s one lesson the designers of Go learned from dynamic languages. The lack of a good way to express structured data in code pushed the Java community to adopt the verbose and overly complex XML as a data format.

JSON was proposed as [“The Fat-Free Alternative to XML”](https://fpy.li/3-32) and became a huge success, replacing XML in many contexts. A concise syntax for lists and dictionaries makes an excellent data interchange format.

PHP and Ruby imitated the hash syntax from Perl, using `=>` to link keys to values. JavaScript uses `:` like Python. Why use two characters when one is readable enough?

JSON came from JavaScript, but it also happens to be an almost exact subset of Python syntax. JSON is compatible with Python except for the spelling of the values `true`, `false`, and `null`.

Armin Ronacher [tweeted](https://fpy.li/3-33) that he likes to hack Python’s global namespace to add JSON-compatible aliases for Python’s `True`, `False`, and `None` so he can paste JSON directly in the console. The basic idea:

```
>>> 
```

The syntax everybody now uses for exchanging data is Python’s `dict` and `list` syntax. Now we have the nice syntax with the convenience of preserved insertion order.

Simple and correct.

[^2]:  entry for “hashable” uses the term “hash value” instead of _hash code_. I prefer _hash code_ because that is a concept often discussed in the context of mappings, where items are made of keys and values, so it may be confusing to mention the hash code as a value. In this book, I only use _hash code_.
