# Standard API of Mapping Types

The `collections.abc` module provides the `Mapping` and `MutableMapping` ABCs describing the interfaces of `dict` and similar types. See [Figure 3-1](#mapping_uml).

The main value of the ABCs is documenting and formalizing the standard interfaces for mappings, and serving as criteria for `isinstance` tests in code that needs to support mappings in a broad sense:

```

```

###### Tip

Using `isinstance` with an ABC is often better than checking whether a function argument is of the concrete `dict` type, because then alternative mapping types can be used. We’ll discuss this in detail in [Chapter 13](ch13.html#ifaces_prot_abc).

###### Figure 3-1. Simplified UML class diagram for the `MutableMapping` and its superclasses from `collections.abc` (inheritance arrows point from subclasses to superclasses; names in italic are abstract classes and abstract methods).

To implement a custom mapping, it’s easier to extend `collections.UserDict`, or to wrap a `dict` by composition, instead of subclassing these ABCs. The `collections.UserDict` class and all concrete mapping classes in the standard library encapsulate the basic `dict` in their implementation, which in turn is built on a hash table. Therefore, they all share the limitation that the keys must be _hashable_ (the values need not be hashable, only the keys). If you need a refresher, the next section explains.
