## Subclassing UserDict Instead of dict

It’s better to create a new mapping type by extending `collections.UserDict` rather than `dict`. We realize that when we try to extend our `StrKeyDict0` from [Example 3-8](#ex_strkeydict0) to make sure that any keys added to the mapping are stored as `str`.

The main reason why it’s better to subclass `UserDict` rather than `dict` is that the built-in has some implementation shortcuts that end up forcing us to override methods that we can just inherit from `UserDict` with no problems.[^7]

Note that `UserDict` does not inherit from `dict`, but uses composition: it has an internal `dict` instance, called `data`, which holds the actual items. This avoids undesired recursion when coding special methods like `__setitem__`, and simplifies the coding of `__contains__`, compared to [Example 3-8](#ex_strkeydict0).

Thanks to `UserDict`, `StrKeyDict` ([Example 3-9](#ex_strkeydict)) is more concise than `StrKeyDict0` ([Example 3-8](#ex_strkeydict0)), but it does more: it stores all keys as `str`, avoiding unpleasant surprises if the instance is built or updated with data containing nonstring keys.

##### Example 3-9. `StrKeyDict` always converts nonstring keys to `str` on insertion, update, and lookup

```
import
```

[![^1]

`StrKeyDict` extends `UserDict`.

[![^2]

`__missing__` is exactly as in [Example 3-8](#ex_strkeydict0).

[![^3]

`__contains__` is simpler: we can assume all stored keys are `str`, and we can check on `self.data` instead of invoking `self.keys()` as we did in `StrKeyDict0`.

[![^4]

`__setitem__` converts any `key` to a `str`. This method is easier to overwrite when we can delegate to the `self.data` attribute.

Because `UserDict` extends `abc.MutableMapping`, the remaining methods that make `StrKeyDict` a full-fledged mapping are inherited from `UserDict`, `MutableMapping`, or `Mapping`. The latter have several useful concrete methods, in spite of being abstract base classes (ABCs). The following methods are worth noting:

`MutableMapping.update`

This powerful method can be called directly but is also used by `__init__` to load the instance from other mappings, from iterables of `(key, value)` pairs, and keyword arguments. Because it uses `self[key] = value` to add items, it ends up calling our implementation of `__setitem__`.

`Mapping.get`

In `StrKeyDict0` ([Example 3-8](#ex_strkeydict0)), we had to code our own `get` to return the same results as `__getitem__`, but in [Example 3-9](#ex_strkeydict) we inherited `Mapping.get`, which is implemented exactly like `StrKeyDict0.get` (see the [Python source code](https://fpy.li/3-14)).

###### Tip

Antoine Pitrou authored [PEP 455—Adding a key-transforming dictionary to collections](https://fpy.li/pep455) and a patch to enhance the `collections` module with a `TransformDict`, that is more general than `StrKeyDict` and preserves the keys as they are provided, before the transformation is applied. PEP 455 was rejected in May 2015—see Raymond Hettinger’s [rejection message](https://fpy.li/3-15). To experiment with `TransformDict`, I extracted Pitrou’s patch from [issue18986](https://fpy.li/3-16) into a standalone module ([_03-dict-set/transformdict.py_](https://fpy.li/3-17) in the [_Fluent Python_ second edition code repository](https://fpy.li/code)).

We know there are immutable sequence types, but how about an immutable mapping? Well, there isn’t a real one in the standard library, but a stand-in is available. That’s next.
