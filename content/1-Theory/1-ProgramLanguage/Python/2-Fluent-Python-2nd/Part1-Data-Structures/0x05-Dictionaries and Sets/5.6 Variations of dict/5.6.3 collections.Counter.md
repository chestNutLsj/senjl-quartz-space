## collections.Counter

A mapping that holds an integer count for each key. Updating an existing key adds to its count. This can be used to count instances of hashable objects or as a multiset (discussed later in this section). `Counter` implements the `+` and `-` operators to combine tallies, and other useful methods such as `most_common([n])`, which returns an ordered list of tuples with the _n_ most common items and their counts; see the [documentation](https://fpy.li/3-9). Here is `Counter` used to count letters in words:

```
>>> 
```

Note that the `'b'` and `'r'` keys are tied in third place, but `ct.most_common(3)` shows only three counts.

To use `collections.Counter` as a multiset, pretend each key is an element in the set, and the count is the number of occurrences of that element in the set.
