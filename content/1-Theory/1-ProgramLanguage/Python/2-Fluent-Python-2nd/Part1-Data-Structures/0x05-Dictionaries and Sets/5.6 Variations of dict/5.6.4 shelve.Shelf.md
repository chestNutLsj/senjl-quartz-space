## shelve.Shelf

The `shelve` module in the standard library provides persistent storage for a mapping of string keys to Python objects serialized in the `pickle` binary format. The curious name of `shelve` makes sense when you realize that pickle jars are stored on shelves.

The `shelve.open` module-level function returns a `shelve.Shelf` instance—a simple key-value DBM database backed by the `dbm` module, with these characteristics:

- `shelve.Shelf` subclasses `abc.MutableMapping`, so it provides the essential methods we expect of a mapping type.
    
- In addition, `shelve.Shelf` provides a few other I/O management methods, like `sync` and `close`.
    
- A `Shelf` instance is a context manager, so you can use a `with` block to make sure it is closed after use.
    
- Keys and values are saved whenever a new value is assigned to a key.
    
- The keys must be strings.
    
- The values must be objects that the `pickle` module can serialize.
    

The documentation for the [shelve](https://fpy.li/3-10), [dbm](https://fpy.li/3-11), and [pickle](https://fpy.li/3-12) modules provides more details and some caveats.

###### Warning

Python’s `pickle` is easy to use in the simplest cases, but has several drawbacks. Read Ned Batchelder’s [“Pickle’s nine flaws”](https://fpy.li/3-13) before adopting any solution involving `pickle`. In his post, Ned mentions other serialization formats to consider.

`OrderedDict`, `ChainMap`, `Counter`, and `Shelf` are ready to use but can also be customized by subclassing. In contrast, `UserDict` is intended only as a base class to be extended.
