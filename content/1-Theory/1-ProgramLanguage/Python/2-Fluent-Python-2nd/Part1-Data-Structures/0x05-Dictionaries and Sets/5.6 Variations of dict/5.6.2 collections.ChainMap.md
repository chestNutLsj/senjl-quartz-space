## collections.ChainMap

A `ChainMap` instance holds a list of mappings that can be searched as one. The lookup is performed on each input mapping in the order it appears in the constructor call, and succeeds as soon as the key is found in one of those mappings. For example:

```
>>> 
```

The `ChainMap` instance does not copy the input mappings, but holds references to them. Updates or insertions to a `ChainMap` only affect the first input mapping. Continuing from the previous example:

```
>>> 
```

`ChainMap` is useful to implement interpreters for languages with nested scopes, where each mapping represents a scope context, from the innermost enclosing scope to the outermost scope. [The “ChainMap objects” section of the `collections` docs](https://fpy.li/3-8) has several examples of `ChainMap` usage, including this snippet inspired by the basic rules of variable lookup in Python:

```
import
```

[Example 18-14](ch18.html#environment_class_ex) shows a `ChainMap` subclass used to implement an interpreter for a subset of the Scheme programming language.
