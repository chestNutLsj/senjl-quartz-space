## Set Literals

The syntax of `set` literals—`{1}`, `{1, 2}`, etc.—looks exactly like the math notation, with one important exception: there’s no literal notation for the empty `set`, so we must remember to write `set()`.

# Syntax Quirk

Don’t forget that to create an empty `set`, you should use the constructor without an argument: `set()`. If you write `{}`, you’re creating an empty `dict`—this hasn’t changed in Python 3.

In Python 3, the standard string representation of sets always uses the `{…}` notation, except for the empty set:

```
>>> 
```

Literal `set` syntax like `{1, 2, 3}` is both faster and more readable than calling the constructor (e.g., `set([1, 2, 3])`). The latter form is slower because, to evaluate it, Python has to look up the `set` name to fetch the constructor, then build a list, and finally pass it to the constructor. In contrast, to process a literal like `{1, 2, 3}`, Python runs a specialized `BUILD_SET` bytecode.[^10]

There is no special syntax to represent `frozenset` literals—they must be created by calling the constructor. The standard string representation in Python 3 looks like a `frozenset` constructor call. Note the output in the console session:

```
>>> 
```

Speaking of syntax, the idea of listcomps was adapted to build sets as well.
