# What’s New in This Chapter

The most important update in this chapter is [“Pattern Matching with Sequences”](#sequence_patterns_sec). That’s the first time the new pattern matching feature of Python 3.10 appears in this second edition.

Other changes are not updates but improvements over the first edition:

- New diagram and description of the internals of sequences, contrasting containers and flat sequences
    
- Brief comparison of the performance and storage characteristics of `list` versus `tuple`
    
- Caveats of tuples with mutable elements, and how to detect them if needed
    

I moved coverage of named tuples to [“Classic Named Tuples”](ch05.html#classic_named_tuples_sec) in [Chapter 5](ch05.html#data_class_ch), where they are compared to `typing.NamedTuple` and `@dataclass`.

###### Note

To make room for new content and keep the page count within reason, the section “Managing Ordered Sequences with Bisect” from the first edition is now a [post](https://fpy.li/bisect) in the [_fluentpython.com_](http://fluentpython.com) companion website.
