## Listcomps Versus map and filter

Listcomps do everything the `map` and `filter` functions do, without the contortions of the functionally challenged Python `lambda`. Consider [Example 2-3](#ex_listcomp_x_filter_map).

##### Example 2-3. The same list built by a listcomp and a map/filter composition

I used to believe that `map` and `filter` were faster than the equivalent listcomps, but Alex Martelli pointed out that’s not the case—at least not in the preceding examples. The [_02-array-seq/listcomp_speed.py_](https://fpy.li/2-1) script in [the _Fluent Python_ code repository](https://fpy.li/code) is a simple speed test comparing listcomp with `filter/map`.

I’ll have more to say about `map` and `filter` in [Chapter 7](ch07.html#functions_as_objects). Now we turn to the use of listcomps to compute Cartesian products: a list containing tuples built from all items from two or more lists.
