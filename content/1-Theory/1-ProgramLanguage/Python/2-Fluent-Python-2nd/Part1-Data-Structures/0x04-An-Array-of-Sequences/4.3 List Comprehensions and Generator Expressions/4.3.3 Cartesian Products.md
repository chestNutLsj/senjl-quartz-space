## Cartesian Products

Listcomps can build lists from the Cartesian product of two or more iterables. The items that make up the Cartesian product are tuples made from items from every input iterable. The resulting list has a length equal to the lengths of the input iterables multiplied. See [Figure 2-3](#cartesian_product_fig).

###### Figure 2-3. The Cartesian product of 3 card ranks and 4 suits is a sequence of 12 pairings.

For example, imagine you need to produce a list of T-shirts available in two colors and three sizes. [Example 2-4](#ex_listcomp_cartesian) shows how to produce that list using a listcomp. The result has six items.

```

This generates a list of tuples arranged by color, then size.

[![^2]

Note how the resulting list is arranged as if the `for` loops were nested in the same order as they appear in the listcomp.

To get items arranged by size, then color, just rearrange the `for` clauses; adding a line break to the listcomp makes it easier to see how the result will be ordered.

In [Example 1-1](ch01.html#ex_pythonic_deck) ([Chapter 1](ch01.html#data_model)), I used the following expression to initialize a card deck with a list made of 52 cards from all 13 ranks of each of the 4 suits, sorted by suit, then rank:

        `self``.``_cards` `=` `[``Card``(``rank``,` `suit``)` `for` `suit` `in` `self``.``suits`
                                        `for` `rank` `in` `self``.``ranks``]`

Listcomps are a one-trick pony: they build lists. To generate data for other sequence types, a genexp is the way to go. The next section is a brief look at genexps in the context of building sequences that are not lists.
