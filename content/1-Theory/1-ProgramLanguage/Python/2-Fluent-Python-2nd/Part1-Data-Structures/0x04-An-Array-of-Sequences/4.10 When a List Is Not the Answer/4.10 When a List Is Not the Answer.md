# When a List Is Not the Answer

The `list` type is flexible and easy to use, but depending on specific requirements, there are better options. For example, an `array` saves a lot of memory when you need to handle millions of floating-point values. On the other hand, if you are constantly adding and removing items from opposite ends of a list, it’s good to know that a `deque` (double-ended queue) is a more efficient FIFO[^14] data structure.

###### Tip

If your code frequently checks whether an item is present in a collection (e.g., `item in my_collection`), consider using a `set` for `my_collection`, especially if it holds a large number of items. Sets are optimized for fast membership checking. They are also iterable, but they are not sequences because the ordering of set items is unspecified. We cover them in [Chapter 3](ch03.html#dicts-a-to-z).

For the remainder of this chapter, we discuss mutable sequence types that can replace lists in many cases, starting with arrays.
