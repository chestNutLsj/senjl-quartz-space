### Alternative patterns for lambda

This is the syntax of `lambda` in Scheme, using the syntactic convention that the suffix `…` means the element may appear zero or more times:

```
(
```

A simple pattern for the lambda case `'lambda'` would be this:

       `case` `[``'lambda'``,` `parms``,` `*``body``]` `if` `body``:`

However, that matches any value in the `parms` position, including the first `'x'` in this invalid subject:

```
[
```

The nested list after the `lambda` keyword in Scheme holds the names of the formal parameters for the function, and it must be a list even if it has only one element. It may also be an empty list, if the function takes no parameters—like Python’s `random.random()`.

In [Example 2-12](#ex_match_eval), I made the `'lambda'` pattern safer using a nested sequence pattern:

        `case` `[``'lambda'``,` `[``*``parms``],` `*``body``]` `if` `body``:`
            `return` `Procedure``(``parms``,` `body``,` `env``)`

In a sequence pattern, `*` can appear only once per sequence. Here we have two sequences: the outer and the inner.

Adding the characters `[*]` around `parms` made the pattern look more like the Scheme syntax it handles, and gave us an additional structural check.
