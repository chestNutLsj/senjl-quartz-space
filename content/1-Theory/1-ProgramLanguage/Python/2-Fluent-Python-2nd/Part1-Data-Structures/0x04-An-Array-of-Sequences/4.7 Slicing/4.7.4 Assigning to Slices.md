## Assigning to Slices

Mutable sequences can be grafted, excised, and otherwise modified in place using slice notation on the lefthand side of an assignment statement or as the target of a `del` statement. The next few examples give an idea of the power of this notation:

`>>>` `l` `=` `list``(``range``(``10``)``)`
`>>>` `l`
`[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]`
`>>>` `l``[``2``:``5``]` `=` `[``20``,` `30``]`
`>>>` `l`
`[0, 1, 20, 30, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]`
`>>>` `del` `l``[``5``:``7``]`
`>>>` `l`
`[0, 1, 20, 30, 5, 8, 9]`
`>>>` `l``[``3``:``:``2``]` `=` `[``11``,` `22``]`
`>>>` `l`
`[0, 1, 20, 11, 5, 22, 9]`
`>>>` `l``[``2``:``5``]` `=` `100`  [![^1]
`Traceback (most recent call last): `  `File` `"<stdin>"``, line` `1``, in` `<module>`
`TypeError``:` `can only assign an iterable`
`>>>` `l``[``2``:``5``]` `=` `[``100``]`
`>>>` `l`
`[0, 1, 100, 22, 9]`

When the target of the assignment is a slice, the righthand side must be an iterable object, even if it has just one item.

Every coder knows that concatenation is a common operation with sequences. Introductory Python tutorials explain the use of `+` and `*` for that purpose, but there are some subtle details on how they work, which we cover next.
