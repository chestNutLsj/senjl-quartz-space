## Multidimensional Slicing and Ellipsis

The `[]` operator can also take multiple indexes or slices separated by commas. The `__getitem__` and `__setitem__` special methods that handle the `[]` operator simply receive the indices in `a[i, j]` as a tuple. In other words, to evaluate `a[i, j]`, Python calls `a.__getitem__((i, j))`.

This is used, for instance, in the external NumPy package, where items of a two-dimensional `numpy.ndarray` can be fetched using the syntax `a[i, j]` and a two-dimensional slice obtained with an expression like `a[m:n, k:l]`. [Example 2-22](#ex_numpy_array) later in this chapter shows the use of this notation.

Except for `memoryview`, the built-in sequence types in Python are one-dimensional, so they support only one index or slice, and not a tuple of them.[^6]

The ellipsis—written with three full stops (`...`) and not `…` (Unicode U+2026)—is recognized as a token by the Python parser. It is an alias to the `Ellipsis` object, the single instance of the `ellipsis` class.[^7] to learn more about this.

At the time of this writing, I am unaware of uses of `Ellipsis` or multidimensional indexes and slices in the Python standard library. If you spot one, let me know. These syntactic features exist to support user-defined types and extensions such as NumPy.

Slices are not just useful to extract information from sequences; they can also be used to change mutable sequences in place—that is, without rebuilding them from scratch.
