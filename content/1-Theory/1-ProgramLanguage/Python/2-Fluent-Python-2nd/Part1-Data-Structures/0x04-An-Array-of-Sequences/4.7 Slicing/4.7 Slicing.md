# Slicing

A common feature of `list`, `tuple`, `str`, and all sequence types in Python is the support of slicing operations, which are more powerful than most people realize.

In this section, we describe the _use_ of these advanced forms of slicing. Their implementation in a user-defined class will be covered in [Chapter 12](ch12.html#user_defined_sequences), in keeping with our philosophy of covering ready-to-use classes in this part of the book, and creating new classes in [Part III](part03.html#classes_protocols_part).
