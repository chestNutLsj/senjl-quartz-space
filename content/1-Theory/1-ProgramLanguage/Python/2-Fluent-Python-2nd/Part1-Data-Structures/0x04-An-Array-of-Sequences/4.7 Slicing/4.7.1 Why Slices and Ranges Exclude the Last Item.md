## Why Slices and Ranges Exclude the Last Item

The Pythonic convention of excluding the last item in slices and ranges works well with the zero-based indexing used in Python, C, and many other languages. Some convenient features of the convention are:

- It’s easy to see the length of a slice or range when only the stop position is given: `range(3)` and `my_list[:3]` both produce three items.
    
- It’s easy to compute the length of a slice or range when start and stop are given: just subtract `stop - start`.
    
- It’s easy to split a sequence in two parts at any index `x`, without overlapping: simply get `my_list[:x]` and `my_list[x:]`. For example:
    
    ```
    >>> 
    ```
    

The best arguments for this convention were written by the Dutch computer scientist Edsger W. Dijkstra (see the last reference in [“Further Reading”](#array_fur_reading_sec)).

Now let’s take a close look at how Python interprets slice notation.
