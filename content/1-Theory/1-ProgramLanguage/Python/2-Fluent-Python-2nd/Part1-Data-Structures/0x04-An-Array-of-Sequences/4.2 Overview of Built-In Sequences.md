# Overview of Built-In Sequences

The standard library offers a rich selection of sequence types implemented in C:

Container sequences

Can hold items of different types, including nested containers. Some examples: `list`, `tuple`, and `collections.deque`.

Flat sequences

Hold items of one simple type. Some examples: `str`, `bytes`, and `array.array`.

A _container sequence_ holds references to the objects it contains, which may be of any type, while a _flat sequence_ stores the value of its contents in its own memory space, not as distinct Python objects. See [Figure 2-1](#container_v_flat_img).

###### Figure 2-1. Simplified memory diagrams for a `tuple` and an `array`, each with three items. Gray cells represent the in-memory header of each Python object—not drawn to proportion. The `tuple` has an array of references to its items. Each item is a separate Python object, possibly holding references to other Python objects, like that two-item list. In contrast, the Python `array` is a single object, holding a C language array of three doubles.

Thus, flat sequences are more compact, but they are limited to holding primitive machine values like bytes, integers, and floats.

###### Note

Every Python object in memory has a header with metadata. The simplest Python object, a `float`, has a value field and two metadata fields:

- `ob_refcnt`: the object’s reference count
    
- `ob_type`: a pointer to the object’s type
    
- `ob_fval`: a C `double` holding the value of the `float`
    

On a 64-bit Python build, each of those fields takes 8 bytes. That’s why an array of floats is much more compact than a tuple of floats: the array is a single object holding the raw values of the floats, while the tuple consists of several objects—the tuple itself and each `float` object contained in it.

Another way of grouping sequence types is by mutability:

Mutable sequences

For example, `list`, `bytearray`, `array.array`, and `collections.deque`.

Immutable sequences

For example, `tuple`, `str`, and `bytes`.

[Figure 2-2](#sequence_uml) helps visualize how mutable sequences inherit all methods from immutable sequences, and implement several additional methods. The built-in concrete sequence types do not actually subclass the `Sequence` and `MutableSequence` abstract base classes (ABCs), but they are _virtual subclasses_ registered with those ABCs—as we’ll see in [Chapter 13](ch13.html#ifaces_prot_abc). Being virtual subclasses, `tuple` and `list` pass these tests:

Keep in mind these common traits: mutable versus immutable; container versus flat. They are helpful to extrapolate what you know about one sequence type to others.

The most fundamental sequence type is the `list`: a mutable container. I expect you are very familiar with lists, so we’ll jump right into list comprehensions, a powerful way of building lists that is sometimes underused because the syntax may look unusual at first. Mastering list comprehensions opens the door to generator expressions, which—among other uses—can produce elements to fill up sequences of any type. Both are the subject of the next section.
