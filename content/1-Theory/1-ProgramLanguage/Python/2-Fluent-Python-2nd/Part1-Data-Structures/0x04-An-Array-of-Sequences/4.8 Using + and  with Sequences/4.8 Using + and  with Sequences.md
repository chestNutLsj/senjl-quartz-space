# Using + and * with Sequences

Python programmers expect that sequences support `+` and `*`. Usually both operands of `+` must be of the same sequence type, and neither of them is modified, but a new sequence of that same type is created as result of the concatenation.

To concatenate multiple copies of the same sequence, multiply it by an integer. Again, a new sequence is created:

```
>>> 
```

Both `+` and `*` always create a new object, and never change their operands.

###### Warning

Beware of expressions like `a * n` when `a` is a sequence containing mutable items, because the result may surprise you. For example, trying to initialize a list of lists as `my_list = [[]] * 3` will result in a list with three references to the same inner list, which is probably not what you want.

The next section covers the pitfalls of trying to use `*` to initialize a list of lists.
