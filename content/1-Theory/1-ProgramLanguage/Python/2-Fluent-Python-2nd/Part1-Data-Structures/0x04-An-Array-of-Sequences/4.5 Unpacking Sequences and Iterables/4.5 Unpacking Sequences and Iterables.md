# Unpacking Sequences and Iterables

Unpacking is important because it avoids unnecessary and error-prone use of indexes to extract elements from sequences. Also, unpacking works with any iterable object as the data source—including iterators, which don’t support index notation (`[]`). The only requirement is that the iterable yields exactly one item per variable in the receiving end, unless you use a star (`*`) to capture excess items, as explained in [“Using * to Grab Excess Items”](#tuple_star).

The most visible form of unpacking is _parallel assignment_; that is, assigning items from an iterable to a tuple of variables, as you can see in this example:

```
>>> 
```

An elegant application of unpacking is swapping the values of variables without using a temporary variable:

```
>>> 
```

Another example of unpacking is prefixing an argument with `*` when calling a function:

```
>>> 
```

The preceding code shows another use of unpacking: allowing functions to return multiple values in a way that is convenient to the caller. As another example, the `os.path.split()` function builds a tuple `(path, last_part)` from a filesystem path:

```
>>> 
```

Another way of using just some of the items when unpacking is to use the `*` syntax, as we’ll see right away.
