## Nested Unpacking

The target of an unpacking can use nesting, e.g., `(a, b, (c, d))`. Python will do the right thing if the value has the same nesting structure. [Example 2-8](#ex_nested_tuple) shows nested unpacking in action.

##### Example 2-8. Unpacking nested tuples to access the longitude

```
metro_areas
```

[![^1]

Each tuple holds a record with four fields, the last of which is a coordinate pair.

[![^2]

By assigning the last field to a nested tuple, we unpack the coordinates.

[![^3]

The `lon <= 0:` test selects only cities in the Western hemisphere.

The output of [Example 2-8](#ex_nested_tuple) is:

                |  latitude | longitude
Mexico City     |   19.4333 |  -99.1333
New York-Newark |   40.8086 |  -74.0204
São Paulo       |  -23.5478 |  -46.6358

The target of an unpacking assignment can also be a list, but good use cases are rare. Here is the only one I know: if you have a database query that returns a single record (e.g., the SQL code has a `LIMIT 1` clause), then you can unpack and at the same time make sure there’s only one result with this code:

```
>>> 
```

If the record has only one field, you can get it directly, like this:

```
>>> 
```

Both of these could be written with tuples, but don’t forget the syntax quirk that single-item tuples must be written with a trailing comma. So the first target would be `(record,)` and the second `((field,),)`. In both cases you get a silent bug if you forget a comma.[^3]

Now let’s study pattern matching, which supports even more powerful ways to unpack sequences.
