## Unpacking with * in Function Calls and Sequence Literals

[PEP 448—Additional Unpacking Generalizations](https://fpy.li/pep448) introduced more flexible syntax for iterable unpacking, best summarized in [“What’s New In Python 3.5”](https://fpy.li/2-4).

In function calls, we can use `*` multiple times:

```
>>> 
```

The `*` can also be used when defining `list`, `tuple`, or `set` literals, as shown in these examples from [“What’s New In Python 3.5”](https://fpy.li/2-4):

```
>>> 
```

PEP 448 introduced similar new syntax for `**`, which we’ll see in [“Unpacking Mappings”](ch03.html#dict_unpacking_sec).

Finally, a powerful feature of tuple unpacking is that it works with nested structures.
