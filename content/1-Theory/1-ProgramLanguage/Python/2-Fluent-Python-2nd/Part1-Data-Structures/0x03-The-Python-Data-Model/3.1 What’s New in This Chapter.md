# What’s New in This Chapter

This chapter had few changes from the first edition because it is an introduction to the Python Data Model, which is quite stable. The most significant changes are:

- Special methods supporting asynchronous programming and other new features, added to the tables in [“Overview of Special Methods”](#overview_special_methods).
    
- [Figure 1-2](#collection_uml) showing the use of special methods in [“Collection API”](#collection_api), including the `collections.abc.Collection` abstract base class introduced in Python 3.6.
    

Also, here and throughout this second edition I adopted the _f-string_ syntax introduced in Python 3.6, which is more readable and often more convenient than the older string formatting notations: the `str.format()` method and the `%` operator.

###### Tip

One reason to still use `my_fmt.format()` is when the definition of `my_fmt` must be in a different place in the code than where the formatting operation needs to happen. For instance, when `my_fmt` has multiple lines and is better defined in a constant, or when it must come from a configuration file, or from the database. Those are real needs, but don’t happen very often.
