# Why len Is Not a Method

I asked this question to core developer Raymond Hettinger in 2013, and the key to his answer was a quote from [“The Zen of Python”](https://fpy.li/1-8): “practicality beats purity.” In [“How Special Methods Are Used”](#how_special_used), I described how `len(x)` runs very fast when `x` is an instance of a built-in type. No method is called for the built-in objects of CPython: the length is simply read from a field in a C struct. Getting the number of items in a collection is a common operation and must work efficiently for such basic and diverse types as `str`, `list`, `memoryview`, and so on.

In other words, `len` is not called as a method because it gets special treatment as part of the Python Data Model, just like `abs`. But thanks to the special method `__len__`, you can also make `len` work with your own custom objects. This is a fair compromise between the need for efficient built-in objects and the consistency of the language. Also from “The Zen of Python”: “Special cases aren’t special enough to break the rules.”

###### Note

If you think of `abs` and `len` as unary operators, you may be more inclined to forgive their functional look and feel, as opposed to the method call syntax one might expect in an object-oriented language. In fact, the ABC language—a direct ancestor of Python that pioneered many of its features—had an `#` operator that was the equivalent of `len` (you’d write `#s`). When used as an infix operator, written `x#s`, it counted the occurrences of `x` in `s`, which in Python you get as `s.count(x)`, for any sequence `s`.
