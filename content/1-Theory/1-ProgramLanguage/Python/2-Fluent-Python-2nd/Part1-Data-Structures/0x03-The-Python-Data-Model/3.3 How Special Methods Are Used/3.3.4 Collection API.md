## Collection API

[Figure 1-2](#collection_uml) documents the interfaces of the essential collection types in the language. All the classes in the diagram are ABCs—_abstract base classes_. ABCs and the `collections.abc` module are covered in [Chapter 13](ch13.html#ifaces_prot_abc). The goal of this brief section is to give a panoramic view of Python’s most important collection interfaces, showing how they are built from special methods.

###### Figure 1-2. UML class diagram with fundamental collection types. Method names in _italic_ are abstract, so they must be implemented by concrete subclasses such as `list` and `dict`. The remaining methods have concrete implementations, therefore subclasses can inherit them.

Each of the top ABCs has a single special method. The `Collection` ABC (new in Python 3.6) unifies the three essential interfaces that every collection should implement:

- `Iterable` to support `for`, [unpacking](https://fpy.li/1-7), and other forms of iteration
    
- `Sized` to support the `len` built-in function
    
- `Container` to support the `in` operator
    

Python does not require concrete classes to actually inherit from any of these ABCs. Any class that implements `__len__` satisfies the `Sized` interface.

Three very important specializations of `Collection` are:

- `Sequence`, formalizing the interface of built-ins like `list` and `str`
    
- `Mapping`, implemented by `dict`, `collections.defaultdict`, etc.
    
- `Set`, the interface of the `set` and `frozenset` built-in types
    

Only `Sequence` is `Reversible`, because sequences support arbitrary ordering of their contents, while mappings and sets do not.

###### Note

Since Python 3.7, the `dict` type is officially “ordered,” but that only means that the key insertion order is preserved. You cannot rearrange the keys in a `dict` however you like.

All the special methods in the `Set` ABC implement infix operators. For example, `a & b` computes the intersection of sets `a` and `b`, and is implemented in the `__and__` special method.

The next two chapters will cover standard library sequences, mappings, and sets in detail.

Now let’s consider the major categories of special methods defined in the Python Data Model.
