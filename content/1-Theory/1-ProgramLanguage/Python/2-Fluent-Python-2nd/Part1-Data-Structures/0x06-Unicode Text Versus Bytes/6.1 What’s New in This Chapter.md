# What’s New in This Chapter

Support for Unicode in Python 3 has been comprehensive and stable, so the most notable addition is [“Finding Characters by Name”](#finding_chars_sec), describing a utility for searching the Unicode database—a great way to find circled digits and smiling cats from the command line.

One minor change worth mentioning is the Unicode support on Windows, which is better and simpler since Python 3.6, as we’ll see in [“Beware of Encoding Defaults”](#encoding_defaults).

Let’s start with the not-so-new, but fundamental concepts of characters, code points, and bytes.

###### Note

For the second edition, I expanded the section about the `struct` module and published it online at [“Parsing binary records with struct”](https://fpy.li/4-3), in the [_fluentpython.com_](http://fluentpython.com) companion website.

There you will also find [“Building Multi-character Emojis”](https://fpy.li/4-4), describing how to make country flags, rainbow flags, people with different skin tones, and diverse family icons by combining Unicode characters.
