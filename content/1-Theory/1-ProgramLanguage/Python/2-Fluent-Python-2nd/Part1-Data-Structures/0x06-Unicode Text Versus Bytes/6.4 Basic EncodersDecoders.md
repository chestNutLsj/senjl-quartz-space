# Basic Encoders/Decoders

The Python distribution bundles more than 100 _codecs_ (encoder/decoders) for text to byte conversion and vice versa. Each codec has a name, like `'utf_8'`, and often aliases, such as `'utf8'`, `'utf-8'`, and `'U8'`, which you can use as the `encoding` argument in functions like `open()`, `str.encode()`, `bytes.decode()`, and so on. [Example 4-4](#ex_codecs) shows the same text encoded as three different byte sequences.

##### Example 4-4. The string “El Niño” encoded with three codecs producing very different byte sequences

```
>>> 
```

[Figure 4-1](#encodings_demo_fig) demonstrates a variety of codecs generating bytes from characters like the letter “A” through the G-clef musical symbol. Note that the last three encodings are variable-length, multibyte encodings.

###### Figure 4-1. Twelve characters, their code points, and their byte representation (in hex) in 7 different encodings (asterisks indicate that the character cannot be represented in that encoding).

All those asterisks in [Figure 4-1](#encodings_demo_fig) make clear that some encodings, like ASCII and even the multibyte GB2312, cannot represent every Unicode character. The UTF encodings, however, are designed to handle every Unicode code point.

The encodings shown in [Figure 4-1](#encodings_demo_fig) were chosen as a representative sample:

`latin1` a.k.a. `iso8859_1`

Important because it is the basis for other encodings, such as `cp1252` and Unicode itself (note how the `latin1` byte values appear in the `cp1252` bytes and even in the code points).

`cp1252`

A useful `latin1` superset created by Microsoft, adding useful symbols like curly quotes and € (euro); some Windows apps call it “ANSI,” but it was never a real ANSI standard.

`cp437`

The original character set of the IBM PC, with box drawing characters. Incompatible with `latin1`, which appeared later.

`gb2312`

Legacy standard to encode the simplified Chinese ideographs used in mainland China; one of several widely deployed multibyte encodings for Asian languages.

`utf-8`

The most common 8-bit encoding on the web, by far, as of July 2021, [“W3Techs: Usage statistics of character encodings for websites”](https://fpy.li/4-5) claims that 97% of sites use UTF-8, up from 81.4% when I wrote this paragraph in the first edition of this book in September 2014.

`utf-16le`

One form of the UTF 16-bit encoding scheme; all UTF-16 encodings support code points beyond U+FFFF through escape sequences called “surrogate pairs.”

###### Warning

UTF-16 superseded the original 16-bit Unicode 1.0 encoding—UCS-2—way back in 1996. UCS-2 is still used in many systems despite being deprecated since the last century because it only supports code points up to U+FFFF. As of 2021, more than 57% of the allocated code points are above U+FFFF, including the all-important emojis.

With this overview of common encodings now complete, we move to handling issues in encoding and decoding operations.
