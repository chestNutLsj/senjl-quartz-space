## Utility Functions for Normalized Text Matching

As we’ve seen, NFC and NFD are safe to use and allow sensible comparisons between Unicode strings. NFC is the best normalized form for most applications. `str.casefold()` is the way to go for case-insensitive comparisons.

If you work with text in many languages, a pair of functions like `nfc_equal` and `fold_equal` in [Example 4-13](#ex_normeq) are useful additions to your toolbox.

Beyond Unicode normalization and case folding—which are both part of the Unicode standard—sometimes it makes sense to apply deeper transformations, like changing `'café'` into `'cafe'`. We’ll see when and how in the next section.
