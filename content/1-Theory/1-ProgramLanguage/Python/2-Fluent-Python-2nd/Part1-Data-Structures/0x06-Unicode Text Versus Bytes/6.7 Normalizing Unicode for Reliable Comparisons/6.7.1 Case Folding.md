## Case Folding

Case folding is essentially converting all text to lowercase, with some additional transformations. It is supported by the `str.casefold()` method.

For any string `s` containing only `latin1` characters, `s.casefold()` produces the same result as `s.lower()`, with only two exceptions—the micro sign `'µ'` is changed to the Greek lowercase mu (which looks the same in most fonts) and the German Eszett or “sharp s” (ß) becomes “ss”:

```
>>> 
```

There are nearly 300 code points for which `str.casefold()` and `str.lower()` return different results.

As usual with anything related to Unicode, case folding is a hard issue with plenty of linguistic special cases, but the Python core team made an effort to provide a solution that hopefully works for most users.

In the next couple of sections, we’ll put our normalization knowledge to use developing utility functions.
