# Handling Text Files

The best practice for handling text I/O is the “Unicode sandwich” ([Figure 4-2](#unicode_sandwich_fig)).[^5]. The “filling” of the sandwich is the business logic of your program, where text handling is done exclusively on `str` objects. You should never be encoding or decoding in the middle of other processing. On output, the `str` are encoded to `bytes` as late as possible. Most web frameworks work like that, and we rarely touch `bytes` when using them. In Django, for example, your views should output Unicode `str`; Django itself takes care of encoding the response to `bytes`, using UTF-8 by default.

Python 3 makes it easier to follow the advice of the Unicode sandwich, because the `open()` built-in does the necessary decoding when reading and encoding when writing files in text mode, so all you get from `my_file.read()` and pass to `my_file.write(text)` are `str` objects.

Therefore, using text files is apparently simple. But if you rely on default encodings, you will get bitten.

Consider the console session in [Example 4-8](#ex_cafe_file1). Can you spot the bug?

##### Example 4-8. A platform encoding issue (if you try this on your machine, you may or may not see the problem)

```
>>> 
```

The bug: I specified UTF-8 encoding when writing the file but failed to do so when reading it, so Python assumed Windows default file encoding—code page 1252—and the trailing bytes in the file were decoded as characters `'Ã©'` instead of `'é'`.

I ran [Example 4-8](#ex_cafe_file1) on Python 3.8.1, 64 bits, on Windows 10 (build 18363). The same statements running on recent GNU/Linux or macOS work perfectly well because their default encoding is UTF-8, giving the false impression that everything is fine. If the encoding argument was omitted when opening the file to write, the locale default encoding would be used, and we’d read the file correctly using the same encoding. But then this script would generate files with different byte contents depending on the platform or even depending on locale settings in the same platform, creating compatibility problems.

###### Tip

Code that has to run on multiple machines or on multiple occasions should never depend on encoding defaults. Always pass an explicit `encoding=` argument when opening text files, because the default may change from one machine to the next, or from one day to the next.

A curious detail in [Example 4-8](#ex_cafe_file1) is that the `write` function in the first statement reports that four characters were written, but in the next line five characters are read. [Example 4-9](#ex_cafe_file2) is an extended version of [Example 4-8](#ex_cafe_file1), explaining that and other details.

##### Example 4-9. Closer inspection of [Example 4-8](#ex_cafe_file1) running on Windows reveals the bug and how to fix it

[![^1]

By default, `open` uses text mode and returns a `TextIOWrapper` object with a specific encoding.

[![^2]

The `write` method on a `TextIOWrapper` returns the number of Unicode characters written.

[![^3]

`os.stat` says the file has 5 bytes; UTF-8 encodes `'é'` as 2 bytes, 0xc3 and 0xa9.

[![^4]

Opening a text file with no explicit encoding returns a `TextIOWrapper` with the encoding set to a default from the locale.

[![^5]

A `TextIOWrapper` object has an encoding attribute that you can inspect: `cp1252` in this case.

[![^6]

In the Windows `cp1252` encoding, the byte 0xc3 is an “Ã” (A with tilde), and 0xa9 is the copyright sign.

[![^7]

Opening the same file with the correct encoding.

[![^8]

The expected result: the same four Unicode characters for `'café'`.

[![^9]

The `'rb'` flag opens a file for reading in binary mode.

[![^10]

The returned object is a `BufferedReader` and not a `TextIOWrapper`.

[![^11]

Reading that returns bytes, as expected.

###### Tip

Do not open text files in binary mode unless you need to analyze the file contents to determine the encoding—even then, you should be using Chardet instead of reinventing the wheel (see [“How to Discover the Encoding of a Byte Sequence”](#discover_encoding)). Ordinary code should only use binary mode to open binary files, like raster 0-Assets/Epubook/Fluent%20Python%20Clear,%20Concise,%20and%20Effective%20Programming/images.

The problem in [Example 4-9](#ex_cafe_file2) has to do with relying on a default setting while opening a text file. There are several sources for such defaults, as the next section shows.
