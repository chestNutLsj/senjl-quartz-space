## Coping with UnicodeDecodeError

Not every byte holds a valid ASCII character, and not every byte sequence is valid UTF-8 or UTF-16; therefore, when you assume one of these encodings while converting a binary sequence to text, you will get a `UnicodeDecodeError` if unexpected bytes are found.

On the other hand, many legacy 8-bit encodings like `'cp1252'`, `'iso8859_1'`, and `'koi8_r'` are able to decode any stream of bytes, including random noise, without reporting errors. Therefore, if your program assumes the wrong 8-bit encoding, it will silently decode garbage.

###### Tip

Garbled characters are known as gremlins or mojibake (文字化け—Japanese for “transformed text”).

[Example 4-6](#ex_decoding) illustrates how using the wrong codec may produce gremlins or a `UnicodeDecodeError`.

##### Example 4-6. Decoding from `str` to bytes: success and error handling

```

```

[![^1]

The word “Montréal” encoded as `latin1`; `'\xe9'` is the byte for “é”.

[![^2]

Decoding with Windows 1252 works because it is a superset of `latin1`.

[![^3]

ISO-8859-7 is intended for Greek, so the `'\xe9'` byte is misinterpreted, and no error is issued.

[![^4]

KOI8-R is for Russian. Now `'\xe9'` stands for the Cyrillic letter “И”.

[![^5]

The `'utf_8'` codec detects that `octets` is not valid UTF-8, and raises `UnicodeDecodeError`.

[![^6]

Using `'replace'` error handling, the `\xe9` is replaced by “�” (code point U+FFFD), the official Unicode `REPLACEMENT CHARACTER` intended to represent unknown characters.
