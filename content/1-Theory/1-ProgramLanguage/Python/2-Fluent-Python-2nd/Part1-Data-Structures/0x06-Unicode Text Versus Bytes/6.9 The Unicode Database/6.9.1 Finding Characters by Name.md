## Finding Characters by Name

The `unicodedata` module has functions to retrieve character metadata, including `unicodedata.name()`, which returns a character’s official name in the standard. [Figure 4-5](#unicodedata_name_fig) demonstrates that function.[^10]

You can use the `name()` function to build apps that let users search for characters by name. [Figure 4-6](#cf_demo_fig) demonstrates the _cf.py_ command-line script that takes one or more words as arguments, and lists the characters that have those words in their official Unicode names. The full source code for _cf.py_ is in [Example 4-21](#ex_cfpy).

###### Warning

Emoji support varies widely across operating systems and apps. In recent years the macOS terminal offers the best support for emojis, followed by modern GNU/Linux graphic terminals. Windows _cmd.exe_ and PowerShell now support Unicode output, but as I write this section in January 2020, they still don’t display emojis—at least not “out of the box.” Tech reviewer Leonardo Rochael told me about a new, open source [Windows Terminal by Microsoft](https://fpy.li/4-24), which may have better Unicode support than the older Microsoft consoles. I did not have time to try it.

In [Example 4-21](#ex_cfpy), note the `if` statement in the `find` function using the `.issubset()` method to quickly test whether all the words in the `query` set appear in the list of words built from the character’s name. Thanks to Python’s rich set API, we don’t need a nested `for` loop and another `if` to implement this check.

##### Example 4-21. cf.py: the character finder utility

```
#!/usr/bin/env python3
```

[![^1]

Set defaults for the range of code points to search.

[![^2]

`find` accepts `query_words` and optional keyword-only arguments to limit the range of the search, to facilitate testing.

[![^3]

Convert `query_words` into a set of uppercased strings.

[![^4]

Get the Unicode character for `code`.

[![^5]

Get the name of the character, or `None` if the code point is unassigned.

[![^6]

If there is a name, split it into a list of words, then check that the `query` set is a subset of that list.

[![^7]

Print out line with code point in `U+9999` format, the character, and its name.

The `unicodedata` module has other interesting functions. Next, we’ll see a few that are related to getting information from characters that have numeric meaning.
