# The Unicode Database

The Unicode standard provides an entire database—in the form of several structured text files—that includes not only the table mapping code points to character names, but also metadata about the individual characters and how they are related. For example, the Unicode database records whether a character is printable, is a letter, is a decimal digit, or is some other numeric symbol. That’s how the `str` methods `isalpha`, `isprintable`, `isdecimal`, and `isnumeric` work. `str.casefold` also uses information from a Unicode table.

###### Note

The `unicodedata.category(char)` function returns the two-letter category of `char` from the Unicode database. The higher-level `str` methods are easier to use. For example, [`label.isalpha()`](https://fpy.li/4-21) returns `True` if every character in `label` belongs to one of these categories: `Lm`, `Lt`, `Lu`, `Ll`, or `Lo`. To learn what those codes mean, see [“General Category”](https://fpy.li/4-22) in the English Wikipedia’s [“Unicode character property” article](https://fpy.li/4-23).
