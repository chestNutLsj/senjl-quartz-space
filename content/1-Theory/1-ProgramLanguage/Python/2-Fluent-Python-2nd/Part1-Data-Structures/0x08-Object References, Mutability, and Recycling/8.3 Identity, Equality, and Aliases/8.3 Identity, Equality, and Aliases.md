# Identity, Equality, and Aliases

Lewis Carroll is the pen name of Prof. Charles Lutwidge Dodgson. Mr. Carroll is not only equal to Prof. Dodgson, they are one and the same. [Example 6-3](#ex_equal_and_same) expresses this idea in Python.

##### Example 6-3. `charles` and `lewis` refer to the same object

```
>>> 
```

[![^1]

`lewis` is an alias for `charles`.

[![^2]

The `is` operator and the `id` function confirm it.

[![^3]

Adding an item to `lewis` is the same as adding an item to `charles`.

However, suppose an impostor—let’s call him Dr. Alexander Pedachenko—claims he is Charles L. Dodgson, born in 1832. His credentials may be the same, but Dr. Pedachenko is not Prof. Dodgson. [Figure 6-2](#alias_x_copy) illustrates this scenario.

###### Figure 6-2. `charles` and `lewis` are bound to the same object; `alex` is bound to a separate object of equal value.

[Example 6-4](#ex_equal_not_same) implements and tests the `alex` object depicted in [Figure 6-2](#alias_x_copy).

##### Example 6-4. `alex` and `charles` compare equal, but `alex` _is not_ `charles`

```
>>> 
```

[![^1]

`alex` refers to an object that is a replica of the object assigned to `charles`.

[![^2]

The objects compare equal because of the `__eq__` implementation in the `dict` class.

[![^3]

But they are distinct objects. This is the Pythonic way of writing the negative identity comparison: `a is not b`.

[Example 6-3](#ex_equal_and_same) is an example of _aliasing_. In that code, `lewis` and `charles` are aliases: two variables bound to the same object. On the other hand, `alex` is not an alias for `charles`: these variables are bound to distinct objects. The objects bound to `alex` and `charles` have the same _value_—that’s what `==` compares—but they have different identities.

In _The Python Language Reference_, [“3.1. Objects, values and types”](https://fpy.li/6-2) states:

> An object’s identity never changes once it has been created; you may think of it as the object’s address in memory. The `is` operator compares the identity of two objects; the `id()` function returns an integer representing its identity.

The real meaning of an object’s ID is implementation dependent. In CPython, `id()` returns the memory address of the object, but it may be something else in another Python interpreter. The key point is that the ID is guaranteed to be a unique integer label, and it will never change during the life of the object.

In practice, we rarely use the `id()` function while programming. Identity checks are most often done with the `is` operator, which compares the object IDs, so our code doesn’t need to call `id()` explicitly. Next, we’ll talk about `is` versus `==`.

###### Tip

For tech reviewer Leonardo Rochael, the most frequent use for `id()` is while debugging, when the `repr()` of two objects look alike, but you need to understand whether two references are aliases or point to separate objects. If the references are in different contexts—such as different stack frames—using the `is` operator may not be viable.
