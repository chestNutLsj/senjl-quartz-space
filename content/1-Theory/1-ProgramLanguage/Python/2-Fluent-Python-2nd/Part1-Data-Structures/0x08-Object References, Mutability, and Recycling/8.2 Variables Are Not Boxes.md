# Variables Are Not Boxes

In 1997, I took a summer course on Java at MIT. The professor, Lynn Stein,[^1] made the point that the usual “variables as boxes” metaphor actually hinders the understanding of reference variables in object-oriented languages. Python variables are like reference variables in Java; a better metaphor is to think of variables as labels with names attached to objects. The next example and figure will help you understand why.

[Example 6-1](#ex_a_b_refs) is a simple interaction that the “variables as boxes” idea cannot explain. [Figure 6-1](#var-boxes-x-labels) illustrates why the box metaphor is wrong for Python, while sticky notes provide a helpful picture of how variables actually work.

##### Example 6-1. Variables `a` and `b` hold references to the same list, not copies of the list

```
>>> 
```

[![^1]

Create a list `[1, 2, 3]` and bind the variable `a` to it.

[![^2]

Bind the variable `b` to the same value that `a` is referencing.

[![^3]

Modify the list referenced by `a`, by appending another item.

[![^4]

You can see the effect via the `b` variable. If we think of `b` as a box that stored a copy of the `[1, 2, 3]` from the `a` box, this behavior makes no sense.

###### Figure 6-1. If you imagine variables are like boxes, you can’t make sense of assignment in Python; instead, think of variables as sticky notes, and [Example 6-1](#ex_a_b_refs) becomes easy to explain.

Therefore, the `b = a` statement does not copy the contents of box `a` into box `b`. It attaches the label `b` to the object that already has the label `a`.

Prof. Stein also spoke about assignment in a very deliberate way. For example, when talking about a seesaw object in a simulation, she would say: “Variable _s_ is assigned to the seesaw,” but never “The seesaw is assigned to variable _s_.” With reference variables, it makes much more sense to say that the variable is assigned to an object, and not the other way around. After all, the object is created before the assignment. [Example 6-2](#ex_var_assign_after) proves that the righthand side of an assignment happens first.

Since the verb “to assign” is used in contradictory ways, a useful alternative is “to bind”: Python’s assignment statement `x = …` binds the `x` name to the object created or referenced on the righthand side. And the object must exist before a name can be bound to it, as [Example 6-2](#ex_var_assign_after) proves.

##### Example 6-2. Variables are bound to objects only after the objects are created

```
>>> 
```

[![^1]

The output `Gizmo id: …` is a side effect of creating a `Gizmo` instance.

[![^2]

Multiplying a `Gizmo` instance will raise an exception.

[![^3]

Here is proof that a second `Gizmo` was actually instantiated before the multiplication was attempted.

[![^4]

But variable `y` was never created, because the exception happened while the righthand side of the assignment was being evaluated.

###### Tip

To understand an assignment in Python, read the righthand side first: that’s where the object is created or retrieved. After that, the variable on the left is bound to the object, like a label stuck to it. Just forget about the boxes.

Because variables are mere labels, nothing prevents an object from having several labels assigned to it. When that happens, you have _aliasing_, our next topic.
