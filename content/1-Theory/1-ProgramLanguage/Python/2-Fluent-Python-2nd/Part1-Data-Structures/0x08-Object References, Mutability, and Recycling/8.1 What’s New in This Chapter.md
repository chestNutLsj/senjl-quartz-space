# What’s New in This Chapter

The topics covered here are very fundamental and stable. There were no changes worth mentioning in this second edition.

I added an example of using `is` to test for a sentinel object, and a warning about misuses of the `is` operator at the end of [“Choosing Between == and is”](#choosing_eq_v_is_sec).

This chapter used to be in Part IV, but I decided to bring it up earlier because it works better as an ending to Part II, “Data Structures,” than an opening to “Object-Oriented Idioms.”

###### Note

The section on “Weak References” from the first edition of this book is now a [post at _fluentpython.com_](https://fpy.li/weakref).

Let’s start by unlearning that a variable is like a box where you store data.
