# Function Parameters as References

The only mode of parameter passing in Python is _call by sharing_. That is the same mode used in most object-oriented languages, including JavaScript, Ruby, and Java (this applies to Java reference types; primitive types use call by value). Call by sharing means that each formal parameter of the function gets a copy of each reference in the arguments. In other words, the parameters inside the function become aliases of the actual arguments.

The result of this scheme is that a function may change any mutable object passed as a parameter, but it cannot change the identity of those objects (i.e., it cannot altogether replace an object with another). [ExampleÂ 6-11](#ex_param_pass) shows a simple function using `+=` on one of its parameters. As we pass numbers, lists, and tuples to the function, the actual arguments passed are affected in different ways.

##### Example 6-11. A function may change any mutable object it receives

```
>>> 
```

[![^1]

The number `x` is unchanged.

[![^2]

The list `a` is changed.

[![^3]

The tuple `t` is unchanged.

Another issue related to function parameters is the use of mutable values for defaults, as discussed next.
