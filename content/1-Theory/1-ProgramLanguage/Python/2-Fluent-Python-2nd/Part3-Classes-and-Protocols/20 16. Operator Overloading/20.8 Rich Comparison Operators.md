# Rich Comparison Operators

The handling of the rich comparison operators `==`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `>=`, and `<=` by the Python interpreter is similar to what we just saw, but differs in two important aspects:

- The same set of methods is used in forward and reverse operator calls. The rules are summarized in [Table 16-2](#reversed_rich_comp_op_tbl). For example, in the case of `==`, both the forward and reverse calls invoke `__eq__`, only swapping arguments; and a forward call to `__gt__` is followed by a reverse call to `__lt__` with the arguments swapped.
    
- In the case of `==` and `!=`, if the reverse method is missing, or returns `NotImplemented`, Python compares the object IDs instead of raising `TypeError`.
    

Table 16-2. Rich comparison operators: reverse methods invoked when the initial method call returns `NotImplemented`
|Group|Infix operator|Forward method call|Reverse method call|Fallback|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|Equality|`a == b`|`a.__eq__(b)`|`b.__eq__(a)`|Return `id(a) == id(b)`|
||`a != b`|`a.__ne__(b)`|`b.__ne__(a)`|Return `not (a == b)`|
|Ordering|`a > b`|`a.__gt__(b)`|`b.__lt__(a)`|Raise `TypeError`|
||`a < b`|`a.__lt__(b)`|`b.__gt__(a)`|Raise `TypeError`|
||`a >= b`|`a.__ge__(b)`|`b.__le__(a)`|Raise `TypeError`|
||`a <= b`|`a.__le__(b)`|`b.__ge__(a)`|Raise `TypeError`|

Given these rules, let’s review and improve the behavior of the `Vector.__eq__` method, which was coded as follows in _vector_v5.py_ ([Example 12-16](ch12.html#ex_vector_v5)):

```
class
```

That method produces the results in [Example 16-13](#eq_initial_demo).

##### Example 16-13. Comparing a `Vector` to a `Vector`, a `Vector2d`, and a `tuple`

```
>>> 
```

[![^1]

Two `Vector` instances with equal numeric components compare equal.

[![^2]

A `Vector` and a `Vector2d` are also equal if their components are equal.

[![^3]

A `Vector` is also considered equal to a `tuple` or any iterable with numeric items of equal value.

The result in [Example 16-13](#eq_initial_demo) is probably not desirable. Do we really want a `Vector` to be considered equal to a `tuple` containing the same numbers? I have no hard rule about this; it depends on the application context. The “Zen of Python” says:

> In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.

Excessive liberality in the evaluation of operands may lead to surprising results, and programmers hate surprises.

Taking a clue from Python itself, we can see that `[1,2] == (1, 2)` is `False`. Therefore, let’s be conservative and do some type checking. If the second operand is a `Vector` instance (or an instance of a `Vector` subclass), then use the same logic as the current `__eq__`. Otherwise, return `NotImplemented` and let Python handle that. See [Example 16-14](#ex_vector_v8_eq).

##### Example 16-14. vector_v8.py: improved `__eq__` in the `Vector` class

```
    
```

[![^1]

If the `other` operand is an instance of `Vector` (or of a `Vector` subclass), perform the comparison as before.

[![^2]

Otherwise, return `NotImplemented`.

If you run the tests in [Example 16-13](#eq_initial_demo) with the new `Vector.__eq__` from [Example 16-14](#ex_vector_v8_eq), what you get now is shown in [Example 16-15](#eq_demo_new_eq).

##### Example 16-15. Same comparisons as [Example 16-13](#eq_initial_demo): last result changed

```
>>> 
```

[![^1]

Same result as before, as expected.

[![^2]

Same result as before, but why? Explanation coming up.

[![^3]

Different result; this is what we wanted. But why does it work? Read on…

Among the three results in [Example 16-15](#eq_demo_new_eq), the first one is no news, but the last two were caused by `__eq__` returning `NotImplemented` in [Example 16-14](#ex_vector_v8_eq). Here is what happens in the example with a `Vector` and a `Vector2d`, `vc == v2d`, step-by-step:

1. To evaluate `vc == v2d`, Python calls `Vector.__eq__(vc, v2d)`.
    
2. `Vector.__eq__(vc, v2d)` verifies that `v2d` is not a `Vector` and returns `NotImplemented`.
    
3. Python gets the `NotImplemented` result, so it tries `Vector2d.__eq__(v2d, vc)`.
    
4. `Vector2d.__eq__(v2d, vc)` turns both operands into tuples and compares them: the result is `True` (the code for `Vector2d.__eq__` is in [Example 11-11](ch11.html#ex_vector2d_v3_full)).
    

As for the comparison `va == t3`, between `Vector` and `tuple` in [Example 16-15](#eq_demo_new_eq), the actual steps are:

1. To evaluate `va == t3`, Python calls `Vector.__eq__(va, t3)`.
    
2. `Vector.__eq__(va, t3)` verifies that `t3` is not a `Vector` and returns `NotImplemented`.
    
3. Python gets the `NotImplemented` result, so it tries `tuple.__eq__(t3, va)`.
    
4. `tuple.__eq__(t3, va)` has no idea what a `Vector` is, so it returns `NotImplemented`.
    
5. In the special case of `==`, if the reversed call returns `NotImplemented`, Python compares object IDs as a last resort.
    

We don’t need to implement `__ne__` for `!=` because the fallback behavior of `__ne__` inherited from `object` suits us: when `__eq__` is defined and does not return `NotImplemented`, `__ne__` returns that result negated.

In other words, given the same objects we used in [Example 16-15](#eq_demo_new_eq), the results for `!=` are consistent:

```
>>>
```

The `__ne__` inherited from `object` works like the following code—except that the original is written in C:[^6]

    `def` `__ne__``(``self``,` `other``):`
        `eq_result` `=` `self` `==` `other`
        `if` `eq_result` `is` `NotImplemented``:`
            `return` `NotImplemented`
        `else``:`
            `return` `not` `eq_result`

After covering the essentials of infix operator overloading, let’s turn to a different class of operators: the augmented assignment operators.
