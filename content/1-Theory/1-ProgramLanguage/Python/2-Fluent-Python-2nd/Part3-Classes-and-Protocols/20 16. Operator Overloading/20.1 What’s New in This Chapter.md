# What’s New in This Chapter

Goose typing is a key part of Python, but the `numbers` ABCs are not supported in static typing, so I changed [Example 16-11](#ex_vector_v7) to use duck typing instead of an explicit `isinstance` check against `numbers.Real`.[^2]

I covered the `@` matrix multiplication operator in the first edition of _Fluent Python_ as an upcoming change when 3.5 was still in alpha. Accordingly, that operator is no longer in a side note, but is integrated in the flow of the chapter in [“Using @ as an Infix Operator”](#matmul_operator_sec). I leveraged goose typing to make the implementation of `__matmul__` safer than the one in the first edition, without compromising on flexibility.

[“Further Reading”](#further_reading_op_sec) now has a couple of new references—including a blog post by Guido van Rossum. I also added mentions of two libraries that showcase effective use of operator overloading outside the domain of mathematics: `pathlib` and `Scapy`.
