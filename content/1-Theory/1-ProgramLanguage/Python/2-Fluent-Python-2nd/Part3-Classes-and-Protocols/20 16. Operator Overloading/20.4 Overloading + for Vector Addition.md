# Overloading + for Vector Addition

The `Vector` class is a sequence type, and the section [“3.3.6. Emulating container types”](https://fpy.li/16-6) in the “Data Model” chapter of the official Python documentation says that sequences should support the `+` operator for concatenation and `*` for repetition. However, here we will implement `+` and `*` as mathematical vector operations, which are a bit harder but more meaningful for a `Vector` type.

###### Tip

If users want to concatenate or repeat `Vector` instances, they can convert them to tuples or lists, apply the operator, and convert back—thanks to the fact that `Vector` is iterable and can be constructed from an iterable:

```
>>> 
```

Adding two Euclidean vectors results in a new vector in which the components are the pairwise additions of the components of the operands. To illustrate:

```
>>> 
```

What happens if we try to add two `Vector` instances of different lengths? We could raise an error, but considering practical applications (such as information retrieval), it’s better to fill out the shortest `Vector` with zeros. This is the result we want:

```
>>> 
```

Given these basic requirements, we can implement `__add__` like in [Example 16-4](#ex_vector_add_t1).

##### Example 16-4. `Vector.__add__` method, take #1

```
    
```

[![^1]

`pairs` is a generator that produces tuples `(a, b)`, where `a` is from `self`, and `b` is from `other`. If `self` and `other` have different lengths, `fillvalue` supplies the missing values for the shortest iterable.

[![^2]

A new `Vector` is built from a generator expression, producing one addition for each `(a, b)` from `pairs`.

Note how `__add__` returns a new `Vector` instance, and does not change `self` or `other`.

###### Warning

Special methods implementing unary or infix operators should never change the value of the operands. Expressions with such operators are expected to produce results by creating new objects. Only augmented assignment operators may change the first operand (`self`), as discussed in [“Augmented Assignment Operators”](#augmented_assign_ops).

[Example 16-4](#ex_vector_add_t1) allows adding `Vector` to a `Vector2d`, and `Vector` to a tuple or to any iterable that produces numbers, as [Example 16-5](#ex_vector_add_demo_mixed_ok) proves.

##### Example 16-5. `Vector.__add__` take #1 supports non-`Vector` objects, too

```
>>> 
```

Both uses of `+` in [Example 16-5](#ex_vector_add_demo_mixed_ok) work because `__add__` uses `zip_longest(…)`, which can consume any iterable, and the generator expression to build the new `Vector` merely performs `a + b` with the pairs produced by `zip_longest(…)`, so an iterable producing any number items will do.

However, if we swap the operands ([Example 16-6](#ex_vector_add_demo_mixed_fail)), the mixed-type additions fail.

##### Example 16-6. `Vector.__add__` take #1 fails with non-`Vector` left operands

```
>>> 
```

To support operations involving objects of different types, Python implements a special dispatching mechanism for the infix operator special methods. Given an expression `a + b`, the interpreter will perform these steps (also see [Figure 16-1](#operator_flowchart)):

1. If `a` has `__add__`, call `a.__add__(b)` and return result unless it’s `NotImplemented`.
    
2. If `a` doesn’t have `__add__`, or calling it returns `NotImplemented`, check if `b` has `__radd__`, then call `b.__radd__(a)` and return result unless it’s `NotImplemented`.
    
3. If `b` doesn’t have `__radd__`, or calling it returns `NotImplemented`, raise `TypeError` with an _unsupported operand types_ message.
    

###### Tip

The `__radd__` method is called the “reflected” or “reversed” version of `__add__`. I prefer to call them “reversed” special methods.[^4]

###### Figure 16-1. Flowchart for computing `a + b` with `__add__` and `__radd__`.

Therefore, to make the mixed-type additions in [Example 16-6](#ex_vector_add_demo_mixed_fail) work, we need to implement the `Vector.__radd__` method, which Python will invoke as a fallback if the left operand does not implement `__add__`, or if it does but returns `NotImplemented` to signal that it doesn’t know how to handle the right operand.

###### Warning

Do not confuse `NotImplemented` with `NotImplementedError`. The first, `NotImplemented`, is a special singleton value that an infix operator special method should `return` to tell the interpreter it cannot handle a given operand. In contrast, `NotImplementedError` is an exception that stub methods in abstract classes may `raise` to warn that subclasses must implement them.

The simplest implementation of `__radd__` that works is shown in [Example 16-7](#ex_vector_add_t2).

##### Example 16-7. The `Vector` methods `__add__` and `__radd__`

```
    
```

[![^1]

No changes to `__add__` from [Example 16-4](#ex_vector_add_t1); listed here because `__radd__` uses it.

[![^2]

`__radd__` just delegates to `__add__`.

Often, `__radd__` can be as simple as that: just invoke the proper operator, therefore delegating to `__add__` in this case. This applies to any commutative operator; `+` is commutative when dealing with numbers or our vectors, but it’s not commutative when concatenating sequences in Python.

If `__radd__` simply calls `__add__`, here is another way to achieve the same effect:

    `def` `__add__``(``self``,` `other``):`
        `pairs` `=` `itertools``.``zip_longest``(``self``,` `other``,` `fillvalue``=``0.0``)`
        `return` `Vector``(``a` `+` `b` `for` `a``,` `b` `in` `pairs``)`

    `__radd__` `=` `__add__`

The methods in [Example 16-7](#ex_vector_add_t2) work with `Vector` objects, or any iterable with numeric items, such as a `Vector2d`, a `tuple` of integers, or an `array` of floats. But if provided with a noniterable object, `__add__` raises an exception with a message that is not very helpful, as in [Example 16-8](#ex_vector_error_iter).

##### Example 16-8. `Vector.__add__` method needs an iterable operand

```
>>> 
```

Even worse, we get a misleading message if an operand is iterable but its items cannot be added to the `float` items in the `Vector`. See [Example 16-9](#ex_vector_error_iter_not_add).

##### Example 16-9. `Vector.__add__` method needs an iterable with numeric items

```
>>> 
```

I tried to add `Vector` and a `str`, but the message complains about `float` and `str`.

The problems in Examples [16-8](#ex_vector_error_iter) and [16-9](#ex_vector_error_iter_not_add) actually go deeper than obscure error messages: if an operator special method cannot return a valid result because of type incompatibility, it should return `NotImplemented` and not raise `TypeError`. By returning `NotImplemented`, you leave the door open for the implementer of the other operand type to perform the operation when Python tries the reversed method call.

In the spirit of duck typing, we will refrain from testing the type of the `other` operand, or the type of its elements. We’ll catch the exceptions and return `NotImplemented`. If the interpreter has not yet reversed the operands, it will try that. If the reverse method call returns `NotImplemented`, then Python will raise `TypeError` with a standard error message like “unsupported operand type(s) for +: _Vector_ and _str_.”

The final implementation of the special methods for `Vector` addition is in [Example 16-10](#ex_vector_v6).

##### Example 16-10. vector_v6.py: operator `+` methods added to vector_v5.py ([Example 12-16](ch12.html#ex_vector_v5))

    `def` `__add__``(``self``,` `other``):`
        `try``:`
            `pairs` `=` `itertools``.``zip_longest``(``self``,` `other``,` `fillvalue``=``0.0``)`
            `return` `Vector``(``a` `+` `b` `for` `a``,` `b` `in` `pairs``)`
        `except` `TypeError``:`
            `return` `NotImplemented`

    `def` `__radd__``(``self``,` `other``):`
        `return` `self` `+` `other`

Note that `__add__` now catches a `TypeError` and returns `NotImplemented`.

###### Warning

If an infix operator method raises an exception, it aborts the operator dispatch algorithm. In the particular case of `TypeError`, it is often better to catch it and `return NotImplemented`. This allows the interpreter to try calling the reversed operator method, which may correctly handle the computation with the swapped operands, if they are of different types.

At this point, we have safely overloaded the `+` operator by writing `__add__` and `__radd__`. We will now tackle another infix operator: `*`.
