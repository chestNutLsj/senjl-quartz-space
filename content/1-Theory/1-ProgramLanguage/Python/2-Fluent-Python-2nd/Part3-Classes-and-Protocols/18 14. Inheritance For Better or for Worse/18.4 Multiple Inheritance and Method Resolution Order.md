# Multiple Inheritance and Method Resolution Order

Any language implementing multiple inheritance needs to deal with potential naming conflicts when superclasses implement a method by the same name. This is called the “diamond problem,” illustrated in [Figure 14-1](#diamond_uml) and [Example 14-4](#ex_diamond).

##### Example 14-4. diamond.py: classes `Leaf`, `A`, `B`, `Root` form the graph in [Figure 14-1](#diamond_uml)

```
class
```

[![^1]

`Root` provides `ping`, `pong`, and `__repr__` to make the output easier to read.

[![^2]

The `ping` and `pong` methods in class `A` both call `super()`.

[![^3]

Only the `ping` method in class `B` calls `super()`.

[![^4]

Class `Leaf` implements only `ping`, and it calls `super()`.

Now let’s see the effect of calling the `ping` and `pong` methods on an instance of `Leaf` ([Example 14-5](#ex_diamond_demo)).

##### Example 14-5. Doctests for calling `ping` and `pong` on a `Leaf` object

```
    
```

[![^1]

`leaf1` is an instance of `Leaf`.

[![^2]

Calling `leaf1.ping()` activates the `ping` methods in `Leaf`, `A`, `B`, and `Root`, because the `ping` methods in the first three classes call `super().ping()`.

[![^3]

Calling `leaf1.pong()` activates `pong` in `A` via inheritance, which then calls `super.pong()`, activating `B.pong`.

The activation sequences shown in [Example 14-5](#ex_diamond_demo) and [Figure 14-1](#diamond_uml) are determined by two factors:

- The method resolution order of the `Leaf` class.
    
- The use of `super()` in each method.
    

Every class has an attribute called `__mro__` holding a tuple of references to the superclasses in method resolution order, from the current class all the way to the `object` class.[^7] For the `Leaf` class, this is the `__mro__`:

```
>>> 
```

###### Note

Looking at [Figure 14-1](#diamond_uml), you may think the MRO describes a [breadth-first search](https://fpy.li/14-9), but that’s just a coincidence for that particular class hierarchy. The MRO is computed by a published algorithm called C3. Its use in Python is detailed in Michele Simionato’s [“The Python 2.3 Method Resolution Order”](https://fpy.li/14-10). It’s a challenging read, but Simionato writes: “unless you make strong use of multiple inheritance and you have non-trivial hierarchies, you don’t need to understand the C3 algorithm, and you can easily skip this paper.”

The MRO only determines the activation order, but whether a particular method will be activated in each of the classes depends on whether each implementation calls `super()` or not.

Consider the experiment with the `pong` method. The `Leaf` class does not override it, therefore calling `leaf1.pong()` activates the implementation in the next class of `Leaf.__mro__`: the `A` class. Method `A.pong` calls `super().pong()`. The `B` class is next in the MRO, therefore `B.pong` is activated. But that method doesn’t call `super().pong()`, so the activation sequence ends here.

The MRO takes into account not only the inheritance graph but also the order in which superclasses are listed in a subclass declaration. In other words, if in _diamond.py_ ([Example 14-4](#ex_diamond)) the `Leaf` class was declared as `Leaf(B, A)`, then class `B` would appear before `A` in `Leaf.__mro__`. This would affect the activation order of the `ping` methods, and would also cause `leaf1.pong()` to activate `B.pong` via inheritance, but `A.pong` and `Root.pong` would never run, because `B.pong` doesn’t call `super()`.

When a method calls `super()`, it is a _cooperative method_. Cooperative methods enable _cooperative multiple inheritance_. These terms are intentional: in order to work, multiple inheritance in Python requires the active cooperation of the methods involved. In the `B` class, `ping` cooperates, but `pong` does not.

###### Warning

A noncooperative method can be the cause of subtle bugs. Many coders reading [Example 14-4](#ex_diamond) may expect that when method `A.pong` calls `super.pong()`, that will ultimately activate `Root.pong`. But if `B.pong` is activated before, it drops the ball. That’s why it is recommended that every method `m` of a nonroot class should call `super().m()`.

Cooperative methods must have compatible signatures, because you never know whether `A.ping` will be called before or after `B.ping`. The activation sequence depends on the order of `A` and `B` in the declaration of each subclass that inherits from both.

Python is a dynamic language, so the interaction of `super()` with the MRO is also dynamic. [Example 14-6](#ex_diamond2) shows a surprising result of this dynamic behavior.

##### Example 14-6. diamond2.py: classes to demonstrate the dynamic nature of `super()`

```
from
```

[![^1]

Class `A` comes from _diamond.py_ ([Example 14-4](#ex_diamond)).

[![^2]

Class `U` is unrelated to `A` or `Root` from the `diamond` module.

[![^3]

What does `super().ping()` do? Answer: it depends. Read on.

[![^4]

`LeafUA` subclasses `U` and `A` in this order.

If you create an instance of `U` and try to call `ping`, you get an error:

```
    >>> u = U()
```

The `'super' object` returned by `super()` has no attribute `'ping'` because the MRO of `U` has two classes: `U` and `object`, and the latter has no attribute named `'ping'`.

However, the `U.ping` method is not completely hopeless. Check this out:

```
    >>> leaf2 = LeafUA()
```

The `super().ping()` call in `LeafUA` activates `U.ping`, which cooperates by calling `super().ping()` too, activating `A.ping`, and eventually `Root.ping`.

Note the base classes of `LeafUA` are `(U, A)` in that order. If instead the bases were `(A, U)`, then `leaf2.ping()` would never reach `U.ping`, because the `super().ping()` in `A.ping` would activate `Root.ping`, and that method does not call `super()`.

In a real program, a class like `U` could be a _mixin class_: a class intended to be used together with other classes in multiple inheritance, to provide additional functionality. We’ll study that shortly, in [“Mixin Classes”](#mixin_classes_sec).

To wrap up this discussion of the MRO, [Figure 14-2](#tkwidgets_mro_uml) illustrates part of the complex multiple inheritance graph of the Tkinter GUI toolkit from the Python standard library.

To study the picture, start at the `Text` class at the bottom. The `Text` class implements a full-featured, multiline editable text widget. It provides rich functionality in itself, but also inherits many methods from other classes. The lefthand side shows a plain UML class diagram. On the right, it’s decorated with arrows showing the MRO, as listed in [Example 14-7](#ex_tkinter_text_mro) with the help of a `print_mro` convenience function.

Now let’s talk about mixins.
