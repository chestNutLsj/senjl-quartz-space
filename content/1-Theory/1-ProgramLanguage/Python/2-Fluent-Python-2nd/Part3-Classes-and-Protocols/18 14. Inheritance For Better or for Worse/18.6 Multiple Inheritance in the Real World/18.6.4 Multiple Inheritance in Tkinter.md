## Multiple Inheritance in Tkinter

An extreme example of multiple inheritance in Python’s standard library is the [Tkinter GUI toolkit](https://fpy.li/14-24). I used part of the Tkinter widget hierarchy to illustrate the MRO in [Figure 14-2](#tkwidgets_mro_uml). [Figure 14-5](#tkinter_uml) shows all the widget classes in the `tkinter` base package (there are more widgets in the [`tkinter.ttk` subpackage](https://fpy.li/14-25)).

Tkinter is 25 years old as I write this. It is not an example of current best practices. But it shows how multiple inheritance was used when coders did not appreciate its drawbacks. And it will serve as a counterexample when we cover some good practices in the next section.

Consider these classes from [Figure 14-5](#tkinter_uml):

➊ `Toplevel`: The class of a top-level window in a Tkinter application.

➋ `Widget`: The superclass of every visible object that can be placed on a window.

➌ `Button`: A plain button widget.

➍ `Entry`: A single-line editable text field.

➎ `Text`: A multiline editable text field.

Here are the MROs of those classes, displayed by the `print_mro` function from [Example 14-7](#ex_tkinter_text_mro):

###### Note

By current standards, the class hierarchy of Tkinter is very deep. Few parts of the Python standard library have more than three or four levels of concrete classes, and the same can be said of the Java class library. However, it is interesting to note that the some of the deepest hierarchies in the Java class library are precisely in the packages related to GUI programming: [`java.awt`](https://fpy.li/14-26) and [`javax.swing`](https://fpy.li/14-27). [Squeak](https://fpy.li/14-28), the modern, free version of Smalltalk, includes the powerful and innovative Morphic GUI toolkit, also with a deep class hierarchy. In my experience, GUI toolkits are where inheritance is most useful.

Note how these classes relate to others:

- `Toplevel` is the only graphical class that does not inherit from `Widget`, because it is the top-level window and does not behave like a widget; for example, it cannot be attached to a window or frame. `Toplevel` inherits from `Wm`, which provides direct access functions of the host window manager, like setting the window title and configuring its borders.
    
- `Widget` inherits directly from `BaseWidget` and from `Pack`, `Place`, and `Grid`. These last three classes are geometry managers: they are responsible for arranging widgets inside a window or frame. Each encapsulates a different layout strategy and widget placement API.
    
- `Button`, like most widgets, descends only from `Widget`, but indirectly from `Misc`, which provides dozens of methods to every widget.
    
- `Entry` subclasses `Widget` and `XView`, which support horizontal scrolling.
    
- `Text` subclasses from `Widget`, `XView`, and `YView` for vertical scrolling.
    

We’ll now discuss some good practices of multiple inheritance and see whether Tkinter goes along with them.
