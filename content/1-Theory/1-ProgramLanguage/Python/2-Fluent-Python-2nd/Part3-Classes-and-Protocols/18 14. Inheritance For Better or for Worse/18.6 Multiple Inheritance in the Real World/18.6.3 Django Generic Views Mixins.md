## Django Generic Views Mixins

###### Note

You don’t need to know Django to follow this section. I am using a small part of the framework as a practical example of multiple inheritance, and I will try to give all the necessary background, assuming you have some experience with server-side web development in any language or framework.

In Django, a view is a callable object that takes a `request` argument—an object representing an HTTP request—and returns an object representing an HTTP response. The different responses are what interests us in this discussion. They can be as simple as a redirect response, with no content body, or as complex as a catalog page in an online store, rendered from an HTML template and listing multiple merchandise with buttons for buying, and links to detail pages.

Originally, Django provided a set of functions, called generic views, that implemented some common use cases. For example, many sites need to show search results that include information from numerous items, with the listing spanning multiple pages, and for each item a link to a page with detailed information about it. In Django, a list view and a detail view are designed to work together to solve this problem: a list view renders search results, and a detail view produces a page for each individual item.

However, the original generic views were functions, so they were not extensible. If you needed to do something similar but not exactly like a generic list view, you’d have to start from scratch.

The concept of class-based views was introduced in Django 1.3, along with a set of generic view classes organized as base classes, mixins, and ready-to-use concrete classes. In Django 3.2, the base classes and mixins are in the `base` module of the `django.views.generic` package, pictured in [Figure 14-3](#django_view_base_uml). At the top of the diagram we see two classes that take care of very distinct responsibilities: `View` and `TemplateResponseMixin`.

###### Tip

A great resource to study these classes is the [_Classy Class-Based Views_](https://fpy.li/14-21) website, where you can easily navigate through them, see all methods in each class (inherited, overridden, and added methods), view diagrams, browse their documentation, and jump to their [source code on GitHub](https://fpy.li/14-22).

`View` is the base class of all views (it could be an ABC), and it provides core functionality like the `dispatch` method, which delegates to “handler” methods like `get`, `head`, `post`, etc., implemented by concrete subclasses to handle the different HTTP verbs.[^10] The `RedirectView` class inherits only from `View`, and you can see that it implements `get`, `head`, `post`, etc.

Concrete subclasses of `View` are supposed to implement the handler methods, so why aren’t those methods part of the `View` interface? The reason: subclasses are free to implement just the handlers they want to support. A `TemplateView` is used only to display content, so it only implements `get`. If an HTTP `POST` request is sent to a `TemplateView`, the inherited `View.dispatch` method checks that there is no `post` handler, and produces an HTTP `405 Method Not Allowed` response.[^11]

The `TemplateResponseMixin` provides functionality that is of interest only to views that need to use a template. A `RedirectView`, for example, has no content body, so it has no need of a template and it does not inherit from this mixin. `TemplateResponseMixin` provides behaviors to `TemplateView` and other template-rendering views, such as `ListView`, `DetailView`, etc., defined in the `django.views.generic` subpackages. [Figure 14-4](#django_view_list_uml) depicts the `django.views.generic.list` module and part of the `base` module.

For Django users, the most important class in [Figure 14-4](#django_view_list_uml) is `ListView`, which is an aggregate class, with no code at all (its body is just a docstring). When instantiated, a `ListView` has an `object_list` instance attribute through which the template can iterate to show the page contents, usually the result of a database query returning multiple objects. All the functionality related to generating this iterable of objects comes from the `MultipleObjectMixin`. That mixin also provides the complex pagination logic—to display part of the results in one page and links to more pages.

Suppose you want to create a view that will not render a template, but will produce a list of objects in JSON format. That’s why the `BaseListView` exists. It provides an easy-to-use extension point that brings together `View` and `MultipleObjectMixin` functionality, without the overhead of the template machinery.

The Django class-based views API is a better example of multiple inheritance than Tkinter. In particular, it is easy to make sense of its mixin classes: each has a well-defined purpose, and they are all named with the `…Mixin` suffix.

Class-based views were not universally embraced by Django users. Many do use them in a limited way, as opaque boxes, but when it’s necessary to create something new, a lot of Django coders continue writing monolithic view functions that take care of all those responsibilities, instead of trying to reuse the base views and mixins.

It does take some time to learn how to leverage class-based views and how to extend them to fulfill specific application needs, but I found that it was worthwhile to study them. They eliminate a lot of boilerplate code, make it easier to reuse solutions, and even improve team communication—for example, by defining standard names to templates, and to the variables passed to template contexts. Class-based views are Django views “on rails.”
