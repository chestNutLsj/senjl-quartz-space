## Understand Why Inheritance Is Used in Each Case

When dealing with multiple inheritance, it’s useful to keep straight the reasons why subclassing is done in each particular case. The main reasons are:

- Inheritance of interface creates a subtype, implying an “is-a” relationship. This is best done with ABCs.
    
- Inheritance of implementation avoids code duplication by reuse. Mixins can help with this.
    

In practice, both uses are often simultaneous, but whenever you can make the intent clear, do it. Inheritance for code reuse is an implementation detail, and it can often be replaced by composition and delegation. On the other hand, interface inheritance is the backbone of a framework. Interface inheritance should use only ABCs as base classes, if possible.
