## Avoid Subclassing from Concrete Classes

Subclassing concrete classes is more dangerous than subclassing ABCs and mixins, because instances of concrete classes usually have internal state that can easily be corrupted when you override methods that depend on that state. Even if your methods cooperate by calling `super()`, and the internal state is held in private attributes using the `__x` syntax, there are still countless ways a method override can introduce bugs.

In [“Waterfowl and ABCs”](ch13.html#waterfowl_essay), Alex Martelli quotes Scott Meyer’s _More Effective C++_, which says: “all non-leaf classes should be abstract.” In other words, Meyer recommends that only abstract classes should be subclassed.

If you must use subclassing for code reuse, then the code intended for reuse should be in mixin methods of ABCs or in explicitly named mixin classes.

We will now analyze Tkinter from the point of view of these recommendations.
