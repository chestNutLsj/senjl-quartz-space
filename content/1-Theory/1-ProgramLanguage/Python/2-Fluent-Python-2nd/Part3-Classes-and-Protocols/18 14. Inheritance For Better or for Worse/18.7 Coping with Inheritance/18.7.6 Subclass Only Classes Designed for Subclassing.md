## Subclass Only Classes Designed for Subclassing

In one comment about this chapter, technical reviewer Leonardo Rochael suggested the following warning.

###### Warning

Subclassing any complex class and overriding its methods is error-prone because the superclass methods may ignore the subclass overrides in unexpected ways. As much as possible, avoid overriding methods, or at least restrain yourself to subclassing classes which are designed to be easily extended, and only in the ways in which they were designed to be extended.

That’s great advice, but how do we know whether or how a class was designed to be extended?

The first answer is documentation (sometimes in the form of docstrings or even comments in code). For example, Python’s [`socketserver`](https://fpy.li/14-31) package is described as “a framework for network servers.” Its [`BaseServer`](https://fpy.li/14-32) class is designed for subclassing, as the name suggests. More importantly, the documentation and the [docstring](https://fpy.li/14-33) in the source code of the class explicitly note which of its methods are intended to be overridden by subclasses.

In Python ≥ 3.8, a new way of making those design constraints explicit is provided by [PEP 591—Adding a final qualifier to typing](https://fpy.li/pep591). The PEP introduces a [`@final`](https://fpy.li/14-34) decorator that can be applied to classes or individual methods, so that IDEs or type checkers can report misguided attempts to subclass those classes or override those methods.[^14]
