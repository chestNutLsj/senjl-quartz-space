## Use Explicit Mixins for Code Reuse

If a class is designed to provide method implementations for reuse by multiple unrelated subclasses, without implying an “is-a” relationship, it should be an explicit _mixin class_. Conceptually, a mixin does not define a new type; it merely bundles methods for reuse. A mixin should never be instantiated, and concrete classes should not inherit only from a mixin. Each mixin should provide a single specific behavior, implementing few and very closely related methods. Mixins should avoid keeping any internal state; i.e., a mixin class should not have instance attributes.

There is no formal way in Python to state that a class is a mixin, so it is highly recommended that they are named with a `Mixin` suffix.
