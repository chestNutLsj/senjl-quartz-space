# Mixin Classes

A mixin class is designed to be subclassed together with at least one other class in a multiple inheritance arrangement. A mixin is not supposed to be the only base class of a concrete class, because it does not provide all the functionality for a concrete object, but only adds or customizes the behavior of child or sibling classes.

###### Note

Mixin classes are a convention with no explicit language support in Python and C++. Ruby allows the explicit definition and use of modules that work as mixins—collections of methods that may be included to add functionality to a class. C#, PHP, and Rust implement traits, which are also an explicit form of mixin.

Let’s see a simple but handy example of a mixin class.
