# What’s New in This Chapter

There are no new Python features related to the subject of this chapter, but I heavily edited it based on feedback from technical reviewers of the second edition, especially Leonardo Rochael and Caleb Hattingh.

I wrote a new opening section focusing on the `super()` built-in function, and changed the examples in [“Multiple Inheritance and Method Resolution Order”](#mro_section) for a deeper exploration of how `super()` works to support _cooperative_ _multiple inheritance_.

[“Mixin Classes”](#mixin_classes_sec) is also new. [“Multiple Inheritance in the Real World”](#multi_real_world_sec) was reorganized and covers simpler mixin examples from the standard library, before the complex Django and the complicated Tkinter hierarchies.

As the chapter title suggests, the caveats of inheritance have always been one of the main themes of this chapter. But more and more developers consider it so problematic that I’ve added a couple of paragraphs about avoiding inheritance to the end of [“Chapter Summary”](#inheritance_summary) and [“Further Reading”](#inheritance_further_reading).

We’ll start with an overview of the mysterious `super()` function.
