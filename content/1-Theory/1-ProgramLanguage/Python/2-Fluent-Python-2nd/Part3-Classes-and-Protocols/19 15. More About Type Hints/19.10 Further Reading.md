# Further Reading

Python’s static type system was complex as initially designed, and is getting more complex with each passing year. [Table 15-1](#typing_peps_tbl) lists all the PEPs that I am aware of as of May 2021. It would take a whole book to cover everything.

Table 15-1. PEPs about type hints, with links in the titles. PEP with numbers marked with * are important enough to be mentioned in the opening paragraph of the [`typing` documentation](https://fpy.li/typing). Question marks in the Python column indicate PEPs under discussion or not yet implemented; “n/a” appears in informational PEPs with no specific Python version.

Python’s official documentation hardly keeps up with all that, so [Mypy’s documentation](https://fpy.li/mypy) is an essential reference. [_Robust Python_](https://fpy.li/15-36) by Patrick Viafore (O’Reilly) is the first book with extensive coverage of Python’s static type system that I know about, published August 2021. You may be reading the second such book right now.

The subtle topic of variance has its own [section in PEP 484](https://fpy.li/15-37), and is also covered in the [“Generics”](https://fpy.li/15-38) page of Mypy, as well as in its invaluable [“Common Issues”](https://fpy.li/15-39) page.

[PEP 362—Function Signature Object](https://fpy.li/pep362) is worth reading if you intend to use the `inspect` module that complements the `typing.get_type_hints` function.

If you are interested in the history of Python, you may like to know that Guido van Rossum posted [“Adding Optional Static Typing to Python”](https://fpy.li/15-40) on December 23, 2004.

[“Python 3 Types in the Wild: A Tale of Two Type Systems”](https://fpy.li/15-41) is a research paper by Ingkarat Rak-amnouykit and others from the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute and IBM TJ Watson Research Center. The paper surveys the use of type hints in open source projects on GitHub, showing that most projects don’t use them, and also that most projects that have type hints apparently don’t use a type checker. I found most interesting the discussion of the different semantics of Mypy and Google’s _pytype_, which they conclude are “essentially two different type systems.”

Two seminal papers about gradual typing are Gilad Bracha’s [“Pluggable Type Systems”](https://fpy.li/15-42), and [“Static Typing Where Possible, Dynamic Typing When Needed: The End of the Cold War Between Programming Languages”](https://fpy.li/15-43) by Eric Meijer and Peter Drayton.[^17]

I learned a lot reading the relevant parts of some books about other languages that implement some of the same ideas:

- [_Atomic Kotlin_](https://fpy.li/15-44) by Bruce Eckel and Svetlana Isakova (Mindview)
    
- [_Effective Java_, 3rd ed.,](https://fpy.li/15-45) by Joshua Bloch (Addison-Wesley)
    
- [_Programming with Types: TypeScript Examples_](https://fpy.li/15-46) by Vlad Riscutia (Manning)
    
- [_Programming TypeScript_](https://fpy.li/15-47) by Boris Cherny (O’Reilly)
    
- [_The Dart Programming Language_](https://fpy.li/15-48) by Gilad Bracha (Addison-Wesley)[^18]
    

For some critical views on type systems, I recommend Victor Youdaiken’s posts [“Bad ideas in type theory”](https://fpy.li/15-49) and [“Types considered harmful II”](https://fpy.li/15-50).

Finally, I was surprised to find [“Generics Considered Harmful”](https://fpy.li/15-51) by Ken Arnold, a core contributor to Java from the beginning, as well as coauthor of the first four editions of the official _The Java Programming Language_ book (Addison-Wesley)—in collaboration with James Gosling, the lead designer of Java.

Sadly, Arnold’s criticism applies to Python’s static type system as well. While reading the many rules and special cases of the typing PEPs, I was constantly reminded of this passage from Gosling’s post:

> Which brings up the problem that I always cite for C++: I call it the “Nth order exception to the exception rule.” It sounds like this: “You can do x, except in case y, unless y does z, in which case you can if …”

Fortunately, Python has a key advantage over Java and C++: an optional type system. We can squelch type checkers and omit type hints when they become too cumbersome.

##### Soapbox

Typing Rabbit Holes

When using a type checker, we are sometimes forced to discover and import classes we did not need to know about, and our code has no need to reference—except to write type hints. Such classes are undocumented, probably because they are considered implementation details by the authors of the packages. Here are two examples from the standard library.

To use `cast()` in the `server.sockets` example in [“Type Casting”](#type_casting_sec), I had to scour the vast _asyncio_ documentation and then browse the source code of several modules in that package to discover the undocumented `TransportSocket` class in the equally undocumented `asyncio.trsock` module. Using `socket.socket` instead of `TransportSocket` would be incorrect, because the latter is explicitly not a subtype of the former, according to a [docstring](https://fpy.li/15-52) in the source code.

I fell into a similar rabbit hole when I added type hints to [Example 19-13](ch19.html#primes_procs_top_ex), a simple demonstration of `multiprocessing`. That example uses `SimpleQueue` objects, which you get by calling `multiprocessing.SimpleQueue()`. However, I could not use that name in a type hint, because it turns out that `multiprocessing.SimpleQueue` is not a class! It’s a bound method of the undocumented `multiprocessing.BaseContext` class, which builds and returns an instance of the `SimpleQueue` class defined in the undocumented `multiprocessing.queues` module.

In each of those cases I had to spend a couple of hours to find the right undocumented class to import, just to write a single type hint. This kind of research is part of the job when writing a book. But when writing application code, I’d probably avoid such scavenger hunts for a single offending line and just write `# type: ignore`. Sometimes that’s the only cost-effective solution.

Variance Notation in Other Languages

Variance is a difficult topic, and Python’s type hints syntax is not as good as it could be. This is evidenced by this direct quote from PEP 484:

> Covariance or contravariance is not a property of a type variable, but a property of a generic class defined using this variable.[^19]

If that is the case, why are covariance and contravariance declared with `TypeVar` and not on the generic class?

The authors of PEP 484 worked under the severe self-imposed constraint that type hints should be supported without making any change to the interpreter. This required the introduction of `TypeVar` to define type variables, and also the abuse of `[]` to provide `Klass[T]` syntax for generics—instead of the `Klass<T>` notation used in other popular languages, including C#, Java, Kotlin, and TypeScript. None of these languages require type variables to be declared before use.

In addition, the syntax of Kotlin and C# makes it clear whether the type parameter is covariant, contravariant, or invariant exactly where it makes sense: in the class or interface declaration.

In Kotlin, we could declare the `BeverageDispenser` like this:

```
class
```

The `out` modifier in the formal type parameter means `T` is an “output” type, therefore `BeverageDispenser` is covariant.

You can probably guess how `TrashCan` would be declared:

```
class
```

Given `T` as an “input” formal type parameter, then `TrashCan` is contravariant.

If neither `in` nor `out` appear, then the class is invariant on the parameter.

It’s easy to recall the [“Variance rules of thumb”](#variance_rules_sec) when `out` and `in` are used in the formal type parameters.

This suggests that a good naming convention for covariant and contravariant type variables in Python would be:

```
T_out
```

Then we could define the classes like this:

```
class
```

Is it too late to change the naming convention established in PEP 484?
