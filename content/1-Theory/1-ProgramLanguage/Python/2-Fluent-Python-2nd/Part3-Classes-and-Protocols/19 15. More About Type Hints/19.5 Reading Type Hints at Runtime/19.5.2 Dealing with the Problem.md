## Dealing with the Problem

Given the unstable situation at present, if you need to read annotations at runtime, I recommend:

- Avoid reading `__annotations__` directly; instead, use `inspect.get_annotations` (from Python 3.10) or `typing.get_type_hints` (since Python 3.5).
    
- Write a custom function of your own as a thin wrapper around `in​spect​.get_annotations` or `typing.get_type_hints`, and have the rest of your codebase call that custom function, so that future changes are localized to a single function.
    

To demonstrate the second point, here are the first lines of the `Checked` class defined in [Example 24-5](ch24.html#checked_class_top_ex), which we’ll study in [Chapter 24](ch24.html#class_metaprog):

```
class
```

The `Checked._fields` class method protects other parts of the module from depending directly on `typing.get_type_hints`. If `get_type_hints` changes in the future, requiring additional logic, or you want to replace it with `inspect.get_annotations`, the change is limited to `Checked._fields` and does not affect the rest of your program.

###### Warning

Given the ongoing discussions and proposed changes for runtime inspection of type hints, the official [“Annotations Best Practices”](https://fpy.li/15-28) document is required reading, and is likely to be updated on the road to Python 3.11. That how-to was written by Larry Hastings, the author of [PEP 649—Deferred Evaluation Of Annotations Using Descriptors](https://fpy.li/pep649), an alternative proposal to address the runtime issues raised by [PEP 563—Postponed Evaluation of Annotations](https://fpy.li/pep563).

The remaining sections of this chapter cover generics, starting with how to define a generic class that can be parameterized by its users.
