### Argument key provided, but no default

```
@overload
```

The inputs can be separate items of any type `T` or a single `Iterable[T]`, and `key=` must be a callable that takes an argument of the same type `T`, and returns a value that implements `SupportsLessThan`. The return type of `max` is the same as the actual arguments.

Sample calls that match these overloads:

```
max
```
