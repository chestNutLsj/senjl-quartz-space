### Arguments implementing SupportsLessThan, but key and default not provided

```
@overload
```

In these cases, the inputs are either separate arguments of type `LT` implementing `SupportsLessThan`, or an `Iterable` of such items. The return type of `max` is the same as the actual arguments or items, as we saw in [“Bounded TypeVar”](ch08.html#bounded_typevar_sec).

Sample calls that match these overloads:

```
max
```
