## Takeaways from Overloading max

Type hints allow Mypy to flag a call like `max([None, None])` with this error message:

mymax_demo.py:109: error: Value of type variable "_LT" of "max"
  cannot be "None"

On the other hand, having to write so many lines to support the type checker may discourage people from writing convenient and flexible functions like `max`. If I had to reinvent the `min` function as well, I could refactor and reuse most of the implementation of `max`. But I’d have to copy and paste all overloaded declarations—even though they would be identical for `min`, except for the function name.

My friend João S. O. Bueno—one of the smartest Python devs I know—tweeted [this](https://fpy.li/15-4):

> Although it is this hard to express the signature of `max`—it fits in one’s mind quite easily. My understanding is that the expressiveness of annotation markings is very limited, compared to that of Python.

Now let’s study the `TypedDict` typing construct. It is not as useful as I imagined at first, but has its uses. Experimenting with `TypedDict` demonstrates the limitations of static typing for handling dynamic structures, such as JSON data.
