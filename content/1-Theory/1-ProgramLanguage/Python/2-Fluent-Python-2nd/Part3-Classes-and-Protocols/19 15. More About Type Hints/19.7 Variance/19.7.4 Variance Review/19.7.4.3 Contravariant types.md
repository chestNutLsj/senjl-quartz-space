### Contravariant types

Given `A :> B`, a generic type `K` is contravariant if `K[A] <: K[B]`.

Contravariant generic types reverse the subtype relationship of the actual type parameters.

The `TrashCan` class exemplifies this:

          Refuse :> Biodegradable
TrashCan[Refuse] <: TrashCan[Biodegradable]

A contravariant container is usually a write-only data structure, also known as a “sink.” There are no examples of such collections in the standard library, but there are a few types with contravariant type parameters.

`Callable[[ParamType, …], ReturnType]` is contravariant on the parameter types, but covariant on the `ReturnType`, as we saw in [“Variance in Callable types”](ch08.html#callable_variance_sec). In addition, [`Generator`](https://fpy.li/15-32), [`Coroutine`](https://fpy.li/typecoro), and [`AsyncGenerator`](https://fpy.li/15-33) have one contravariant type parameter. The `Generator` type is described in [“Generic Type Hints for Classic Coroutines”](ch17.html#generic_classic_coroutine_types_sec); `Coroutine` and `AsyncGenerator` are described in [Chapter 21](ch21.html#async_ch).

For the present discussion about variance, the main point is that the contravariant formal parameter defines the type of the arguments used to invoke or send data to the object, while different covariant formal parameters define the types of outputs produced by the object—the yield type or the return type, depending on the object. The meanings of “send” and “yield” are explained in [“Classic Coroutines”](ch17.html#classic_coroutines_sec).

We can derive useful guidelines from these observations of covariant outputs and contravariant inputs.
