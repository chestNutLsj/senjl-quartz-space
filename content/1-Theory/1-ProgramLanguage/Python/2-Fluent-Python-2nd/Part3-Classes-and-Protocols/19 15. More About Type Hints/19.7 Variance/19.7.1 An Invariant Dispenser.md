## An Invariant Dispenser

Let’s try to model the cafeteria scenario with a generic `BeverageDispenser` class that can be parameterized on the type of beverage. See [Example 15-18](#invariant_dispenser_types_ex).

##### Example 15-18. invariant.py: type definitions and `install` function

```
from
```

[![^1]

`Beverage`, `Juice`, and `OrangeJuice` form a type hierarchy.

[![^2]

Simple `TypeVar` declaration.

[![^3]

`BeverageDispenser` is parameterized on the type of beverage.

[![^4]

`install` is a module-global function. Its type hint enforces the rule that only a juice dispenser is acceptable.

Given the definitions in [Example 15-18](#invariant_dispenser_types_ex), the following code is legal:

```
juice_dispenser
```

However, this is not legal:

```
beverage_dispenser
```

A dispenser that serves any `Beverage` is not acceptable because the cafeteria requires a dispenser that is specialized for `Juice`.

Somewhat surprisingly, this code is also illegal:

```
orange_juice_dispenser
```

A dispenser specialized for `OrangeJuice` is not allowed either. Only `BeverageDispenser[Juice]` will do. In the typing jargon, we say that `BeverageDispenser(Generic[T])` is invariant when `BeverageDispenser[OrangeJuice]` is not compatible with `BeverageDispenser[Juice]`—despite the fact that `OrangeJuice` is a _subtype-of_ `Juice`.

Python mutable collection types—such as `list` and `set`—are invariant. The `LottoBlower` class from [Example 15-17](#ex_generic_lotto) is also invariant.
