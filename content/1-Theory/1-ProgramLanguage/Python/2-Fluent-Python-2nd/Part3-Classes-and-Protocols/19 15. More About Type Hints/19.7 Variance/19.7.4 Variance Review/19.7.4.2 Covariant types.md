### Covariant types

Consider two types `A` and `B`, where `B` is _consistent-with_ `A`, and neither of them is `Any`. Some authors use the `<:` and `:>` symbols to denote type relationships like this:

`A :> B`

`A` is a _supertype-of_ or the same as `B`.

`B <: A`

`B` is a _subtype-of_ or the same as `A`.

Given `A :> B`, a generic type `C` is covariant when `C[A] :> C[B]`.

Note the direction of the `:>` symbol is the same in both cases where `A` is to the left of `B`. Covariant generic types follow the subtype relationship of the actual type parameters.

Immutable containers can be covariant. For example, this is how the `typing.FrozenSet` class is [documented](https://fpy.li/15-31) as a covariant with a type variable using the conventional name `T_co`:

```
class
```

Applying the `:>` notation to parameterized types, we have:

           float :> int
frozenset[float] :> frozenset[int]

Iterators are another example of covariant generics: they are not read-only collections like a `frozenset`, but they only produce output. Any code expecting an `abc.Iterator[float]` yielding floats can safely use an `abc.Iterator[int]` yielding integers. `Callable` types are covariant on the return type for a similar reason.
