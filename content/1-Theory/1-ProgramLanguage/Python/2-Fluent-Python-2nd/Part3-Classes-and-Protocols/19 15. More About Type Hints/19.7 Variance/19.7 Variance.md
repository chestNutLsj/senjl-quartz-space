# Variance

###### Note

Depending on your experience with generics in other languages, this may be the most challenging section in the book. The concept of variance is abstract, and a rigorous presentation would make this section look like pages from a math book.

In practice, variance is mostly relevant to library authors who want to support new generic container types or provide callback-based APIs. Even then, you can avoid much complexity by supporting only invariant containers—which is mostly what we have now in the Python standard library. So, on a first reading, you can skip the whole section or just read the sections about invariant types.

We first saw the concept of _variance_ in [“Variance in Callable types”](ch08.html#callable_variance_sec), applied to parameterized generic `Callable` types. Here we’ll expand the concept to cover generic collection types, using a “real world” analogy to make this abstract concept more concrete.

Imagine that a school cafeteria has a rule that only juice dispensers can be installed.[^15]
