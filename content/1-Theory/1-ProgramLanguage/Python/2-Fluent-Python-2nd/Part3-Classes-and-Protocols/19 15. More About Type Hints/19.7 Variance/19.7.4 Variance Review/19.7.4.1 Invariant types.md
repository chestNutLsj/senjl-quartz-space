### Invariant types

A generic type `L` is invariant when there is no supertype or subtype relationship between two parameterized types, regardless of the relationship that may exist between the actual parameters. In other words, if `L` is invariant, then `L[A]` is not a supertype or a subtype of `L[B]`. They are inconsistent in both ways.

As mentioned, Pythonâ€™s mutable collections are invariant by default. The `list` type is a good example: `list[int]` is not _consistent-with_ `list[float]` and vice versa.

In general, if a formal type parameter appears in type hints of method arguments, and the same parameter appears in method return types, that parameter must be invariant to ensure type safety when updating and reading from the collection.

For example, here is part of the type hints for the `list` built-in on [_typeshed_](https://fpy.li/15-30):

```
class
```

Note that `_T` appears in the arguments of `__init__`, `append`, and `extend`, and as the return type of `pop`. There is no way to make such a class type safe if it is covariant or contravariant in `_T`.
