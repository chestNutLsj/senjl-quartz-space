### Variance rules of thumb

Finally, here are a few rules of thumb to reason about when thinking through variance:

- If a formal type parameter defines a type for data that comes out of the object, it can be covariant.
    
- If a formal type parameter defines a type for data that goes into the object after its initial construction, it can be contravariant.
    
- If a formal type parameter defines a type for data that comes out of the object and the same parameter defines a type for data that goes into the object, it must be invariant.
    
- To err on the safe side, make formal type parameters invariant.
    

`Callable[[ParamType, …], ReturnType]` demonstrates rules #1 and #2: The `ReturnType` is covariant, and each `ParamType` is contravariant.

By default, `TypeVar` creates formal parameters that are invariant, and that’s how the mutable collections in the standard library are annotated.

[“Generic Type Hints for Classic Coroutines”](ch17.html#generic_classic_coroutine_types_sec) continues the present discussion about variance.

Next, let’s see how to define generic static protocols, applying the idea of covariance to a couple of new examples.
