# Vector Take #2: A Sliceable Sequence

As we saw with the `FrenchDeck` example, supporting the sequence protocol is really easy if you can delegate to a sequence attribute in your object, like our `self._components` array. These `__len__` and `__getitem__` one-liners are a good start:

```
class
```

With these additions, all of these operations now work:

```
>>> 
```

As you can see, even slicing is supported—but not very well. It would be better if a slice of a `Vector` was also a `Vector` instance and not an `array`. The old `FrenchDeck` class has a similar problem: when you slice it, you get a `list`. In the case of `Vector`, a lot of functionality is lost when slicing produces plain arrays.

Consider the built-in sequence types: every one of them, when sliced, produces a new instance of its own type, and not of some other type.

To make `Vector` produce slices as `Vector` instances, we can’t just delegate the slicing to `array`. We need to analyze the arguments we get in `__getitem__` and do the right thing.

Now, let’s see how Python turns the syntax `my_seq[1:3]` into arguments for `my_seq.__getitem__(...)`.
