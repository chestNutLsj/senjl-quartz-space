# Further Reading

For a quick look at typing pros and cons, as well as the importance of `typing.Protocol` for the health of statically checked codebases, I highly recommend Glyph Lefkowitz’s post [“I Want A New Duck: `typing.Protocol` and the future of duck typing”](https://fpy.li/13-42). I also learned a lot from his post [“Interfaces and Protocols”](https://fpy.li/13-43), comparing `typing.Protocol` and `zope.interface`—an earlier mechanism for defining interfaces in loosely coupled plug-in systems, used by the [Plone CMS](https://fpy.li/13-44), the [Pyramid web framework](https://fpy.li/13-45), and the [Twisted](https://fpy.li/13-46) asynchronous programming framework, a project founded by Glyph.[^28]

Great books about Python have—almost by definition—great coverage of duck typing. Two of my favorite Python books had updates released after the first edition of _Fluent Python_: _The Quick Python Book_, 3rd ed., (Manning), by Naomi Ceder; and [_Python in a Nutshell_, 3rd ed.,](https://fpy.li/pynut3) by Alex Martelli, Anna Ravenscroft, and Steve Holden (O’Reilly).

For a discussion of the pros and cons of dynamic typing, see Guido van Rossum’s interview with Bill Venners in [“Contracts in Python: A Conversation with Guido van Rossum, Part IV”](https://fpy.li/13-47). An insightful and balanced take on this debate is Martin Fowler’s post [“Dynamic Typing”](https://fpy.li/13-48). He also wrote [“Role Interface”](https://fpy.li/13-33), which I mentioned in [“Best Practices for Protocol Design”](#best_protocol_design_sec). Although it is not about duck typing, that post is highly relevant for Python protocol design, as he contrasts narrow role interfaces with the broader public interfaces of classes in general.

The Mypy documentation is often the best source of information for anything related to static typing in Python, including static duck typing, addressed in their [“Protocols and structural subtyping” chapter](https://fpy.li/13-50).

The remaining references are all about goose typing. Beazley and Jones’s _[Python Cookbook](https://fpy.li/pycook3)_, 3rd ed. (O’Reilly) has a section about defining an ABC (Recipe 8.12). The book was written before Python 3.4, so they don’t use the now preferred syntax of declaring ABCs by subclassing from `abc.ABC` (instead, they use the `metaclass` keyword, which we’ll only really need in [Chapter 24](ch24.html#class_metaprog)). Apart from this small detail, the recipe covers the major ABC features very well.

_The Python Standard Library by Example_ by Doug Hellmann (Addison-Wesley), has a chapter about the `abc` module. It’s also available on the web in Doug’s excellent [_PyMOTW_—Python Module of the Week](https://fpy.li/13-51). Hellmann also uses the old style of ABC declaration: `PluginBase(metaclass=abc.ABCMeta)` instead of the simpler `PluginBase(abc.ABC)` available since Python 3.4.

When using ABCs, multiple inheritance is not only common but practically inevitable, because each of the fundamental collection ABCs—`Sequence`, `Mapping`, and `Set`—extends `Collection`, which in turn extends multiple ABCs (see [Figure 13-4](#collections_uml)). Therefore, [Chapter 14](ch14.html#inheritance) is an important follow-up to this one.

[PEP 3119—Introducing Abstract Base Classes](https://fpy.li/13-52) gives the rationale for ABCs. [PEP 3141—A Type Hierarchy for Numbers](https://fpy.li/13-53) presents the ABCs of the [`numbers` module](https://fpy.li/13-54), but the discussion in the Mypy issue [#3186 “int is not a Number?”](https://fpy.li/13-55) includes some arguments about why the numeric tower is unsuitable for static type checking. Alex Waygood wrote a [comprehensive answer on StackOverflow](https://fpy.li/13-56), discussing ways to annotate numeric types. I’ll keep watching Mypy issue [#3186](https://fpy.li/13-55) for the next chapters of this saga, hoping for a happy ending that will make static typing and goose typing compatible—as they should be.

The MVP Journey of Python Static Typing

I work for Thoughtworks, a worldwide leader in Agile software development. At Thoughtworks, we often recommend that our clients should aim to create and deploy MVPs: minimal viable products: “a simple version of a product that is given to users in order to validate the key business assumptions,” as defined by my colleague Paulo Caroli in [“Lean Inception”](https://fpy.li/13-58), a post in [Martin Fowler’s collective blog](https://fpy.li/13-59).

Guido van Rossum and the other core developers who designed and implemented static typing have followed an MVP strategy since 2006. First, [PEP 3107—Function Annotations](https://fpy.li/pep3107) was implemented in Python 3.0 with very limited semantics: just syntax to attach annotations to function parameters and returns. This was done explicitly to allow for experimentation and collect feedback—key benefits of an MVP.

Eight years later, [PEP 484—Type Hints](https://fpy.li/pep484) was proposed and approved. Its implementation in Python 3.5 required no changes in the language or standard library—except for adding the `typing` module, on which no other part of the standard library depended. PEP 484 supported only nominal types with generics—similar to Java—but with the actual static checking done by external tools. Important features were missing, like variable annotations, generic built-in types, and protocols. Despite those limitations, this typing MVP was valuable enough to attract investment and adoption by companies with very large Python codebases, like Dropbox, Google, and Facebook; as well as support from professional IDEs, like [PyCharm](https://fpy.li/13-60), [Wing](https://fpy.li/13-61), and [VS Code](https://fpy.li/13-62).

[PEP 526—Syntax for Variable Annotations](https://fpy.li/pep526) was the first evolutionary step that required changes to the interpreter in Python 3.6. More changes to the Python 3.7 interpreter were made to support [PEP 563—Postponed Evaluation of Annotations](https://fpy.li/pep563) and [PEP 560—Core support for typing module and generic types](https://fpy.li/pep560), which allowed built-in and standard library collections to accept generic type hints out of the box in Python 3.9, thanks to [PEP 585—Type Hinting Generics In Standard Collections](https://fpy.li/pep585).

During those years, some Python users—including me—were underwhelmed by the typing support. After I learned Go, the lack of static duck typing in Python was incomprehensible, in a language where duck typing had always been a core strength.

But that is the nature of MVPs: they may not satisfy all potential users, but they can be implemented with less effort, and guide further development with feedback from actual usage in the field.

If there is one thing we all learned from Python 3, it’s that incremental progress is safer than big-bang releases. I am glad we did not have to wait for Python 4—if it ever comes—to make Python more attractive to large enterprises, where the benefits of static typing outweigh the added complexity.

Typing Approaches in Popular Languages

[Figure 13-8](#type_systems_languages) is a variation of the Typing Map ([Figure 13-1](#type_systems_described)) with the names of a few popular languages that support each of the typing approaches.

![Four approaches to type checking and languages that support them.](assets/flpy_1308.png)

###### Figure 13-8. Four approaches to type checking and some languages that support them.

TypeScript and Python ≥ 3.8 are the only languages in my small and arbitrary sample that support all four approaches.

Go is clearly a statically typed language in the Pascal tradition, but it pioneered static duck typing—at least among languages that are widely used today. I also put Go in the goose typing quadrant because of its type assertions, which allow checking and adapting to different types at runtime.

If I had to draw a similar diagram in the year 2000, only the duck typing and the static typing quadrants would have languages in them. I am not aware of languages that supported static duck typing or goose typing 20 years ago. The fact that each of the four quadrants has at least three popular languages suggests that a lot of people see value in each of the four approaches to typing.

Monkey Patching

Monkey patching has a bad reputation. If abused, it can lead to systems that are hard to understand and maintain. The patch is usually tightly coupled with its target, making it brittle. Another problem is that two libraries that apply monkey patches may step on each other’s toes, with the second library to run destroying patches of the first.

But monkey patching can also be useful, for example, to make a class implement a protocol at runtime. The Adapter design pattern solves the same problem by implementing a whole new class.

It’s easy to monkey patch Python code, but there are limitations. Unlike Ruby and JavaScript, Python does not let you monkey patch the built-in types. I actually consider this an advantage, because you can be certain that a `str` object will always have those same methods. This limitation reduces the chance that external libraries apply conflicting patches.

Metaphors and Idioms in Interfaces

A metaphor fosters understanding by making constraints and affordances clear. That’s the value of the words “stack” and “queue” in describing those fundamental data structures: they make clear which operations are allowed, i.e., how items can be added or removed. On the other hand, Alan Cooper et al. write in _About Face, the Essentials of Interaction Design_, 4th ed. (Wiley):

> Strict adherence to metaphors ties interfaces unnecessarily tightly to the workings of the physical world.

He’s referring to user interfaces, but the admonition applies to APIs as well. But Cooper does grant that when a “truly appropriate” metaphor “falls on our lap,” we can use it (he writes “falls on our lap” because it’s so hard to find fitting metaphors that you should not spend time actively looking for them). I believe the bingo machine imagery I used in this chapter is appropriate and I stand by it.

_About Face_ is by far the best book about UI design I’ve read—and I’ve read a few. Letting go of metaphors as a design paradigm, and replacing it with “idiomatic interfaces” was the most valuable thing I learned from Cooper’s work.

In _About Face_, Cooper does not deal with APIs, but the more I think about his ideas, the more I see how they apply to Python. The fundamental protocols of the language are what Cooper calls “idioms.” Once we learn what a “sequence” is, we can apply that knowledge in different contexts. This is a main theme of _Fluent Python_: highlighting the fundamental idioms of the language, so your code is concise, effective, and readable—for a fluent Pythonista.

Such “deep metaprogramming,” if ever appropriate, is intended for authors of broad frameworks meant to be independently extended by vast numbers of separate development teams…less than 1% of “most advanced Pythonistas” may ever need that! — _A.M._

[^10]:  Before ABCs existed, abstract methods would raise `NotImplementedError` to signal that subclasses were responsible for their implementation. In Smalltalk-80, abstract method bodies would invoke `subclassResponsibility`, a method inherited from `object` that would produce an error with the message, “My subclass should have overridden one of my messages.”
