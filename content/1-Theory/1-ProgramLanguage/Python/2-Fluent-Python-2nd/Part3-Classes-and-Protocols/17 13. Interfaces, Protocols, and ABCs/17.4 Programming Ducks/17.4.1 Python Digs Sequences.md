## Python Digs Sequences

The philosophy of the Python Data Model is to cooperate with essential dynamic protocols as much as possible. When it comes to sequences, Python tries hard to work with even the simplest implementations.

[Figure 13-2](#sequence_uml_repeat) shows how the `Sequence` interface is formalized as an ABC. The Python interpreter and built-in sequences like `list`, `str`, etc., do not rely on that ABC at all. I am using it only to describe what a full-fledged `Sequence` is expected to support.

###### Figure 13-2. UML class diagram for the `Sequence` ABC and related abstract classes from `collections.abc`. Inheritance arrows point from a subclass to its superclasses. Names in italic are abstract methods. Before Python 3.6, there was no `Collection` ABC—`Sequence` was a direct subclass of `Container`, `Iterable`, and `Sized`.

###### Tip

Most ABCs in the `collections.abc` module exist to formalize interfaces that are implemented by built-in objects and are implicitly supported by the interpreter—both of which predate the ABCs themselves. The ABCs are useful as starting points for new classes, and to support explicit type checking at runtime (a.k.a. _goose typing_) as well as type hints for static type checkers.

Studying [Figure 13-2](#sequence_uml_repeat), we see that a correct subclass of `Sequence` must implement `__getitem__` and `__len__` (from `Sized`). All the other methods in `Sequence` are concrete, so subclasses can inherit their implementations—or provide better ones.

Now, recall the `Vowels` class in [Example 13-1](#ex_minimal_sequence). It does not inherit from `abc.Sequence` and it only implements `__getitem__`.

There is no `__iter__` method, yet `Vowels` instances are iterable because—as a fallback—if Python finds a `__getitem__` method, it tries to iterate over the object by calling that method with integer indexes starting with `0`. Because Python is smart enough to iterate over `Vowels` instances, it can also make the `in` operator work even when the `__contains__` method is missing: it does a sequential scan to check if an item is present.

In summary, given the importance of sequence-like data structures, Python manages to make iteration and the `in` operator work by invoking `__getitem__` when `__iter__` and `__contains__` are unavailable.

The original `FrenchDeck` from [Chapter 1](ch01.html#data_model) does not subclass `abc.Sequence` either, but it does implement both methods of the sequence protocol: `__getitem__` and `__len__`. See [Example 13-2](#ex_pythonic_deck_repeat).

##### Example 13-2. A deck as a sequence of cards (same as [Example 1-1](ch01.html#ex_pythonic_deck))

```
import
```

Several of the examples in [Chapter 1](ch01.html#data_model) work because of the special treatment Python gives to anything vaguely resembling a sequence. The iterable protocol in Python represents an extreme form of duck typing: the interpreter tries two different methods to iterate over objects.

To be clear, the behaviors I described in this section are implemented in the interpreter itself, mostly in C. They do not depend on methods from the `Sequence` ABC. For example, the concrete methods `__iter__` and `__contains__` in the `Sequence` class emulate the built-in behaviors of the Python interpreter. If you are curious, check the source code of these methods in [_Lib/_collections_abc.py_](https://fpy.li/13-3).

Now let’s study another example emphasizing the dynamic nature of protocols—and why static type checkers have no chance of dealing with them.
