## ABC Syntax Details

The standard way to declare an ABC is to subclass `abc.ABC` or any other ABC.

Besides the `ABC` base class, and the `@abstractmethod` decorator, the `abc` module defines the `@abstractclassmethod`, `@abstractstaticmethod`, and `@abstractproperty` decorators. However, these last three were deprecated in Python 3.3, when it became possible to stack decorators on top of `@abstractmethod`, making the others redundant. For example, the preferred way to declare an abstract class method is:

```
class
```

###### Warning

The order of stacked function decorators matters, and in the case of `@abstractmethod`, the documentation is explicit:

> When abstractmethod() is applied in combination with other method descriptors, it should be applied as the innermost decorator…[^12]

In other words, no other decorator may appear between `@abstractmethod` and the `def` statement.

Now that we’ve got these ABC syntax issues covered, let’s put `Tombola` to use by implementing two concrete descendants of it.
