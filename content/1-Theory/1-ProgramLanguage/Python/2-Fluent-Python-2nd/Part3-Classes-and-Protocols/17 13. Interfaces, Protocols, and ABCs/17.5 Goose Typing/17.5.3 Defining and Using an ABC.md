## Defining and Using an ABC

This warning appeared in the “Interfaces” chapter of the first edition of _Fluent Python_:

> ABCs, like descriptors and metaclasses, are tools for building frameworks. Therefore, only a small minority of Python developers can create ABCs without imposing unreasonable limitations and needless work on fellow programmers.

Now ABCs have more potential use cases in type hints to support static typing. As discussed in [“Abstract Base Classes”](ch08.html#type_hint_abc_sec), using ABCs instead of concrete types in function argument type hints gives more flexibility to the caller.

To justify creating an ABC, we need to come up with a context for using it as an extension point in a framework. So here is our context: imagine you need to display advertisements on a website or a mobile app in random order, but without repeating an ad before the full inventory of ads is shown. Now let’s assume we are building an ad management framework called `ADAM`. One of its requirements is to support user-provided nonrepeating random-picking classes.[^8] To make it clear to `ADAM` users what is expected of a “nonrepeating random-picking” component, we’ll define an ABC.

In the literature about data structures, “stack” and “queue” describe abstract interfaces in terms of physical arrangements of objects. I will follow suit and use a real-world metaphor to name our ABC: bingo cages and lottery blowers are machines designed to pick items at random from a finite set, without repeating, until the set is exhausted.

The ABC will be named `Tombola`, after the Italian name of bingo and the tumbling container that mixes the numbers.

The `Tombola` ABC has four methods. The two abstract methods are:

`.load(…)`

Put items into the container.

`.pick()`

Remove one item at random from the container, returning it.

The concrete methods are:

`.loaded()`

Return `True` if there is at least one item in the container.

`.inspect()`

Return a `tuple` built from the items currently in the container, without changing its contents (the internal ordering is not preserved).

[Figure 13-5](#tombola_uml) shows the `Tombola` ABC and three concrete implementations.

###### Figure 13-5. UML diagram for an ABC and three subclasses. The name of the `Tombola` ABC and its abstract methods are written in _italics_, per UML conventions. The dashed arrow is used for interface implementation—here I am using it to show that `TomboList` not only implements the `Tombola` interface, but is also registered as _virtual subclass_ of `Tombola`—as we will see later in this chapter.[^9]

[Example 13-7](#ex_tombola_abc) shows the definition of the `Tombola` ABC.

##### Example 13-7. tombola.py: `Tombola` is an ABC with two abstract methods and two concrete methods

```
import
```

[![^1]

To define an ABC, subclass `abc.ABC`.

[![^2]

An abstract method is marked with the `@abstractmethod` decorator, and often its body is empty except for a docstring.[^10]

[![^3]

The docstring instructs implementers to raise `LookupError` if there are no items to pick.

[![^4]

An ABC may include concrete methods.

[![^5]

Concrete methods in an ABC must rely only on the interface defined by the ABC (i.e., other concrete or abstract methods or properties of the ABC).

[![^6]

We can’t know how concrete subclasses will store the items, but we can build the `inspect` result by emptying the `Tombola` with successive calls to `.pick()`…

[![^7]

…then use `.load(…)` to put everything back.

###### Tip

An abstract method can actually have an implementation. Even if it does, subclasses will still be forced to override it, but they will be able to invoke the abstract method with `super()`, adding functionality to it instead of implementing from scratch. See the [`abc` module documentation](https://fpy.li/13-18) for details on `@abstractmethod` usage.

The code for the `.inspect()` method in [Example 13-7](#ex_tombola_abc) is silly, but it shows that we can rely on `.pick()` and `.load(…)` to inspect what’s inside the `Tombola` by picking all items and loading them back—without knowing how the items are actually stored. The point of this example is to highlight that it’s OK to provide concrete methods in ABCs, as long as they only depend on other methods in the interface. Being aware of their internal data structures, concrete subclasses of `Tombola` may always override `.inspect()` with a smarter implementation, but they don’t have to.

The `.loaded()` method in [Example 13-7](#ex_tombola_abc) has one line, but it’s expensive: it calls `.inspect()` to build the `tuple` just to apply `bool()` on it. This works, but a concrete subclass can do much better, as we’ll see.

Note that our roundabout implementation of `.inspect()` requires that we catch a `LookupError` thrown by `self.pick()`. The fact that `self.pick()` may raise `LookupError` is also part of its interface, but there is no way to make this explicit in Python, except in the documentation (see the docstring for the abstract `pick` method in [Example 13-7](#ex_tombola_abc)).

I chose the `LookupError` exception because of its place in the Python hierarchy of exceptions in relation to `IndexError` and `KeyError`, the most likely exceptions to be raised by the data structures used to implement a concrete `Tombola`. Therefore, implementations can raise `LookupError`, `IndexError`, `KeyError`, or a custom subclass of `LookupError` to comply. See [Figure 13-6](#exc_tree_part).

###### Figure 13-6. Part of the `Exception` class hierarchy.[^11]

![^1]

`LookupError` is the exception we handle in `Tombola.inspect`.

![^2]

`IndexError` is the `LookupError` subclass raised when we try to get an item from a sequence with an index beyond the last position.

![^3]

`KeyError` is raised when we use a nonexistent key to get an item from a mapping.

We now have our very own `Tombola` ABC. To witness the interface checking performed by an ABC, let’s try to fool `Tombola` with a defective implementation in [Example 13-8](#fake_tombola_ex).

##### Example 13-8. A fake `Tombola` doesn’t go undetected

```
>>> 
```

[![^1]

Declare `Fake` as a subclass of `Tombola`.

[![^2]

The class was created, no errors so far.

[![^3]

`TypeError` is raised when we try to instantiate `Fake`. The message is very clear: `Fake` is considered abstract because it failed to implement `load`, one of the abstract methods declared in the `Tombola` ABC.

So we have our first ABC defined, and we put it to work validating a class. We’ll soon subclass the `Tombola` ABC, but first we must cover some ABC coding rules.
