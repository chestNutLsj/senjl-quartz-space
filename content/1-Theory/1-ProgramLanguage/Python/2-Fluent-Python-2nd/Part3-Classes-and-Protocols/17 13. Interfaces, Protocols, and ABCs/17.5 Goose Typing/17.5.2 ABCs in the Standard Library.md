## ABCs in the Standard Library

Since Python 2.6, the standard library provides several ABCs. Most are defined in the `collections.abc` module, but there are others. You can find ABCs in the `io` and `numbers` packages, for example. But the most widely used are in `collections.abc`.

###### Tip

There are two modules named `abc` in the standard library. Here we are talking about `collections.abc`. To reduce loading time, since Python 3.4 that module is implemented outside of the `collections` package—in [_Lib/_collections_abc.py_](https://fpy.li/13-14)—so it’s imported separately from `collections`. The other `abc` module is just `abc` (i.e., [_Lib/abc.py_](https://fpy.li/13-15)) where the `abc.ABC` class is defined. Every ABC depends on the `abc` module, but we don’t need to import it ourselves except to create a brand-new ABC.

[Figure 13-4](#collections_uml) is a summary UML class diagram (without attribute names) of 17 ABCs defined in `collections.abc`. The documentation of `collections.abc` has [a nice table](https://fpy.li/13-16) summarizing the ABCs, their relationships, and their abstract and concrete methods (called “mixin methods”). There is plenty of multiple inheritance going on in [Figure 13-4](#collections_uml). We’ll devote most of [Chapter 14](ch14.html#inheritance) to multiple inheritance, but for now it’s enough to say that it is usually not a problem when ABCs are concerned.[^7]

###### Figure 13-4. UML class diagram for ABCs in `collections.abc`.

Let’s review the clusters in [Figure 13-4](#collections_uml):

`Iterable`, `Container`, `Sized`

Every collection should either inherit from these ABCs or implement compatible protocols. `Iterable` supports iteration with `__iter__`, `Container` supports the `in` operator with `__contains__`, and `Sized` supports `len()` with `__len__`.

`Collection`

This ABC has no methods of its own, but was added in Python 3.6 to make it easier to subclass from `Iterable`, `Container`, and `Sized`.

`Sequence`, `Mapping`, `Set`

These are the main immutable collection types, and each has a mutable subclass. A detailed diagram for `MutableSequence` is in [Figure 13-3](#mutablesequence_uml); for `MutableMapping` and `MutableSet`, see Figures [3-1](ch03.html#mapping_uml) and [3-2](ch03.html#set_uml) in [Chapter 3](ch03.html#dicts-a-to-z).

`MappingView`

In Python 3, the objects returned from the mapping methods `.items()`, `.keys()`, and `.values()` implement the interfaces defined in `ItemsView`, `KeysView`, and `ValuesView`, respectively. The first two also implement the rich interface of `Set`, with all the operators we saw in [“Set Operations”](ch03.html#set_op_section).

`Iterator`

Note that iterator subclasses `Iterable`. We discuss this further in [Chapter 17](ch17.html#iterables2generators).

`Callable`, `Hashable`

These are not collections, but `collections.abc` was the first package to define ABCs in the standard library, and these two were deemed important enough to be included. They support type checking objects that must be callable or hashable.

For callable detection, the `callable(obj)` built-in function is more convenient than `insinstance(obj, Callable)`.

If `insinstance(obj, Hashable)` returns `False`, you can be certain that `obj` is not hashable. But if the return is `True`, it may be a false positive. The next box explains.

##### isinstance with Hashable and Iterable Can Be Misleading

It’s easy to misinterpret the results of the `isinstance` and `issubclass` tests against the `Hashable` and `Iterable` ABCs.

If `isinstance(obj, Hashable)` returns `True`, that only means that the class of `obj` implements or inherits `__hash__`. But if `obj` is a `tuple` containing unhashable items, then `obj` is not hashable, despite the positive result of the `isinstance` check. Tech reviewer Jürgen Gmach pointed out that duck typing provides the most accurate way to determine if an instance is hashable: call `hash(obj)`. That call will raise `TypeError` if `obj` is not hashable.

On the other hand, even when `isinstance(obj, Iterable)` returns `False`, Python may still be able to iterate over `obj` using `__getitem__` with 0-based indices, as we saw in [Chapter 1](ch01.html#data_model) and [“Python Digs Sequences”](#python_digs_seq_sec). The documentation for [`collections.abc.Iterable`](https://fpy.li/13-17) states:

> The only reliable way to determine whether an object is iterable is to call `iter(obj)`.

After looking at some existing ABCs, let’s practice goose typing by implementing an ABC from scratch and putting it to use. The goal here is not to encourage everyone to start creating ABCs left and right, but to learn how to read the source code of the ABCs you’ll find in the standard library and other packages.
