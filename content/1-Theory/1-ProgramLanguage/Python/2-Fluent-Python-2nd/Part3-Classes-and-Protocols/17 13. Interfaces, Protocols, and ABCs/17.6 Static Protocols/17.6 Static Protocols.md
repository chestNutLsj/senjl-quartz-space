# Static Protocols

###### Note

Static protocols were introduced in [“Static Protocols”](ch08.html#protocols_in_fn) ([Chapter 8](ch08.html#type_hints_in_def_ch)). I considered delaying all coverage of protocols until this chapter, but decided that the initial presentation of type hints in functions had to include protocols because duck typing is an essential part of Python, and static type checking without protocols doesn’t handle Pythonic APIs very well.

We will wrap up this chapter by illustrating static protocols with two simple examples, and a discussion of numeric ABCs and protocols. Let’s start by showing how a static protocol makes it possible to annotate and type check the `double()` function we first saw in [“Types Are Defined by Supported Operations”](ch08.html#types_defined_by_ops_sec).
