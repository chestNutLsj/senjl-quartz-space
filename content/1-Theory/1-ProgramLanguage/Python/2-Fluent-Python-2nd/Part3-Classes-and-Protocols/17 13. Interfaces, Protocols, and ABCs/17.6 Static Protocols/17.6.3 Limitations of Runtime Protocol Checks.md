## Limitations of Runtime Protocol Checks

We’ve seen that type hints are generally ignored at runtime, and this also affects the use of `isinstance` or `issubclass` checks against static protocols.

For example, any class with a `__float__` method is considered—at runtime—a virtual subclass of `SupportsFloat`, even if the `__float__` method does not return a `float`.

Check out this console session:

```
>>> 
```

In Python 3.9, the `complex` type does have a `__float__` method, but it exists only to raise a `TypeError` with an explicit error message. If that `__float__` method had annotations, the return type would be `NoReturn`—which we saw in [“NoReturn”](ch08.html#noreturn_sec).

But type hinting `complex.__float__` on _typeshed_ would not solve this problem because Python’s runtime generally ignores type hints—and can’t access the _typeshed_ stub files anyway.

Continuing from the previous Python 3.9 session:

```
>>> 
```

So we have misleading results: the runtime checks against `SupportsFloat` suggest that you can convert a `complex` to `float`, but in fact that raises a type error.

###### Warning

The specific isssue with the `complex` type is fixed in Python 3.10.0b4 with the removal of the `complex.__float__` method.

But the overall issue remains: `isinstance`/`issubclass` checks only look at the presence or absence of methods, without checking their signatures, much less their type annotations. And this is not about to change, because such type checks at runtime would have an unacceptable performance cost.[^19]

Now let’s see how to implement a static protocol in a user-defined class.
