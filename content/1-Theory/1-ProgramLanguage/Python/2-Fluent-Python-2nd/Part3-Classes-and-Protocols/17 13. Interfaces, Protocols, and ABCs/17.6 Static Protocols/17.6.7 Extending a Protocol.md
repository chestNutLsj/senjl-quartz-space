## Extending a Protocol

As I mentioned at the start of the previous section, Go developers advocate to err on the side of minimalism when defining interfaces—their name for static protocols. Many of the most widely used Go interfaces have a single method.

When practice reveals that a protocol with more methods is useful, instead of adding methods to the original protocol, it’s better to derive a new protocol from it. Extending a static protocol in Python has a few caveats, as [Example 13-20](#ex_randompickload_protocol) shows.

##### Example 13-20. _randompickload.py_: extending `RandomPicker`

```

```

If you want the derived protocol to be runtime checkable, you must apply the decorator again—its behavior is not inherited.[^22]

[![^2]

Every protocol must explicitly name `typing.Protocol` as one of its base classes in addition to the protocol we are extending. This is different from the way inheritance works in Python.[^23]

[![^3]

Back to “regular” object-oriented programming: we only need to declare the method that is new in this derived protocol. The `pick` method declaration is inherited from `RandomPicker`.

This concludes the final example of defining and using a static protocol in this chapter.

To wrap the chapter, we’ll go over numeric ABCs and their possible replacement with numeric protocols.
