## The Typed double Function

When introducing Python to programmers more used to statically typed languages, one of my favorite examples is this simple `double` function:

```
>>> 
```

Before static protocols were introduced, there was no practical way to add type hints to `double` without limiting its possible uses.[^17]

Thanks to duck typing, `double` works even with types from the future, such as the enhanced `Vector` class that we’ll see in [“Overloading * for Scalar Multiplication”](ch16.html#overloading_mul) ([Chapter 16](ch16.html#operator_overloading)):

```
>>> 
```

The initial implementation of type hints in Python was a nominal type system: the name of a type in an annotation had to match the name of the type of the actual arguments—or the name of one of its superclasses. Since it’s impossible to name all types that implement a protocol by supporting the required operations, duck typing could not be described by type hints before Python 3.8.

Now, with `typing.Protocol` we can tell Mypy that `double` takes an argument `x` that supports `x * 2`. [Example 13-13](#repeatable_protocol_ex) shows how.

We’ll use this `T` in the `__mul__` signature.

[![^2]

`__mul__` is the essence of the `Repeatable` protocol. The `self` parameter is usually not annotated—its type is assumed to be the class. Here we use `T` to make sure the result type is the same as the type of `self`. Also, note that `repeat_count` is limited to `int` in this protocol.

[![^3]

The `RT` type variable is bounded by the `Repeatable` protocol: the type checker will require that the actual type implements `Repeatable`.

[![^4]

Now the type checker is able to verify that the `x` parameter is an object that can be multiplied by an integer, and the return value has the same type as `x`.

This example shows why [PEP 544](https://fpy.li/pep544) is titled “Protocols: Structural subtyping (static duck typing).” The nominal type of the actual argument `x` given to `double` is irrelevant as long as it quacks—that is, as long as it implements `__mul__`.
