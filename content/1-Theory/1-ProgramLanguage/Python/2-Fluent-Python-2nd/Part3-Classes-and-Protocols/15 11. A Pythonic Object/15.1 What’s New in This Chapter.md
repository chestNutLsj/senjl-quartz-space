# What’s New in This Chapter

I added a new epigraph and a few words in the second paragraph of the chapter to address the concept of “Pythonic”—which was only discussed at the very end in the first edition.

[“Formatted Displays”](#format_display_sec) was updated to mention f-strings, introduced in Python 3.6. It’s a small change because f-strings support the same formatting mini-language as the `format()` built-in and the `str.format()` method, so any previously implemented `__format__` methods simply work with f-strings.
