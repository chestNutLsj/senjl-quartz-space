# Object Representations

Every object-oriented language has at least one standard way of getting a string representation from any object. Python has two:

`repr()`

Return a string representing the object as the developer wants to see it. It’s what you get when the Python console or a debugger shows an object.

`str()`

Return a string representing the object as the user wants to see it. It’s what you get when you `print()` an object.

The special methods `__repr__` and `__str__` support `repr()` and `str()`, as we saw in [Chapter 1](ch01.html#data_model).

There are two additional special methods to support alternative representations of objects: `__bytes__` and `__format__`. The `__bytes__` method is analogous to `__str__`: it’s called by `bytes()` to get the object represented as a byte sequence. Regarding `__format__`, it is used by f-strings, by the built-in function `format()`, and by the `str.format()` method. They call `obj.__format__(format_spec)` to get string displays of objects using special formatting codes. We’ll cover `__bytes__` in the next example, and `__format__` after that.

###### Warning

If you’re coming from Python 2, remember that in Python 3 `__repr__`, `__str__`, and `__format__` must always return Unicode strings (type `str`). Only `__bytes__` is supposed to return a byte sequence (type `bytes`).
