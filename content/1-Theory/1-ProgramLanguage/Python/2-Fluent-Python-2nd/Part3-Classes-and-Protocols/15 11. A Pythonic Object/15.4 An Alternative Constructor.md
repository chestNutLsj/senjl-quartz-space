# An Alternative Constructor

Since we can export a `Vector2d` as bytes, naturally we need a method that imports a `Vector2d` from a binary sequence. Looking at the standard library for inspiration, we find that `array.array` has a class method named `.frombytes` that suits our purpose—we saw it in [“Arrays”](ch02.html#arrays_sec). We adopt its name and use its functionality in a class method for `Vector2d` in _vector2d_v1.py_ ([Example 11-3](#ex_vector2d_v1)).

##### Example 11-3. Part of vector2d_v1.py: this snippet shows only the `frombytes` class method, added to the `Vector2d` definition in vector2d_v0.py ([Example 11-2](#ex_vector2d_v0))

[![^1]

The `classmethod` decorator modifies a method so it can be called directly on a class.

[![^2]

No `self` argument; instead, the class itself is passed as the first argument—conventionally named `cls`.

[![^3]

Read the `typecode` from the first byte.

[![^4]

Create a `memoryview` from the `octets` binary sequence and use the `typecode` to cast it.[^4]

[![^5]

Unpack the `memoryview` resulting from the cast into the pair of arguments needed for the constructor.

I just used a `classmethod` decorator and it is very Python specific, so let’s have a word about it.
