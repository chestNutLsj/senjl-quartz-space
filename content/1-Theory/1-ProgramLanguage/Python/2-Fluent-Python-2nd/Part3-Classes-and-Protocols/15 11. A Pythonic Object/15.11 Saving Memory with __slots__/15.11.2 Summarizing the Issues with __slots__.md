## Summarizing the Issues with __slots__

The `__slots__` class attribute may provide significant memory savings if properly used, but there are a few caveats:

- You must remember to redeclare `__slots__` in each subclass to prevent their instances from having `__dict__`.
    
- Instances will only be able to have the attributes listed in `__slots__`, unless you include `'__dict__'` in `__slots__` (but doing so may negate the memory savings).
    
- Classes using `__slots__` cannot use the `@cached_property` decorator, unless they explicitly name `'__dict__'` in `__slots__`.
    
- Instances cannot be targets of weak references, unless you add `'__weakref__'` in `__slots__`.
    

The last topic in this chapter has to do with overriding a class attribute in instances and subclasses.
