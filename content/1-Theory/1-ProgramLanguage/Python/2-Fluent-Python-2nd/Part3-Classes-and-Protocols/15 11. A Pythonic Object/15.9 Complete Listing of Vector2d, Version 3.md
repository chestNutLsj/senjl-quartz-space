# Complete Listing of Vector2d, Version 3

We have been working on `Vector2d` for a while, showing just snippets, so [Example 11-11](#ex_vector2d_v3_full) is a consolidated, full listing of _vector2d_v3.py_, including the doctests I used when developing it.

To recap, in this and the previous sections, we saw some essential special methods that you may want to implement to have a full-fledged object.

###### Note

You should only implement these special methods if your application needs them. End users don’t care if the objects that make up the application are “Pythonic” or not.

On the other hand, if your classes are part of a library for other Python programmers to use, you can’t really guess what they will do with your objects, and they may expect more of the “Pythonic” behaviors we are describing.

As coded in [Example 11-11](#ex_vector2d_v3_full), `Vector2d` is a didactic example with a laundry list of special methods related to object representation, not a template for every user-defined class.

In the next section, we’ll take a break from `Vector2d` to discuss the design and drawbacks of the private attribute mechanism in Python—the double-underscore prefix in `self.__x`.
