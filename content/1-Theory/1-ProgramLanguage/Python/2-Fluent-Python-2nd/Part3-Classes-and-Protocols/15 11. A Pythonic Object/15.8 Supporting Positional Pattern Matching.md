# Supporting Positional Pattern Matching

So far, `Vector2d` instances are compatible with keyword class patterns—covered in [“Keyword Class Patterns”](ch05.html#keyword_class_patterns_sec).

In [Example 11-9](#vector_match_keyword_ex), all of these keyword patterns work as expected.

##### Example 11-9. Keyword patterns for `Vector2d` subjects—requires Python 3.10

```
def
```

However, if you try to use a positional pattern like this:

        `case` `Vector2d``(``_``,` `0``):`
            `print``(``f``'{v!r} is horizontal'``)`

you get:

TypeError: Vector2d() accepts 0 positional sub-patterns (1 given)

To make `Vector2d` work with positional patterns, we need to add a class attribute named `__match_args__` , listing the instance attributes in the order they will be used for positional pattern matching:

```
class
```

Now we can save a few keystrokes when writing patterns to match `Vector2d` subjects, as you can see in [Example 11-10](#vector_match_positional_ex).

```
def
```

The `__match_args__` class attribute does not need to include all public instance attributes. In particular, if the class `__init__` has required and optional arguments that are assigned to instance attributes, it may be reasonable to name the required arguments in `__match_args__`, but not the optional ones.

Let’s step back and review what we’ve coded so far in `Vector2d`.
