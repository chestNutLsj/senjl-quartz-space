# Decorators in the Standard Library

Python has three built-in functions that are designed to decorate methods: `property`, `classmethod`, and `staticmethod`. We’ll discuss `property` in [“Using a Property for Attribute Validation”](ch22.html#prop_validation_sec) and the others in [“classmethod Versus staticmethod”](ch11.html#classmethod_x_staticmethod_sec).

In [Example 9-16](#ex_clockdeco2) we saw another important decorator: `functools.wraps`, a helper for building well-behaved decorators. Some of the most interesting decorators in the standard library are `cache`, `lru_cache`, and `singledispatch`—all from the `functools` module. We’ll cover them next.
