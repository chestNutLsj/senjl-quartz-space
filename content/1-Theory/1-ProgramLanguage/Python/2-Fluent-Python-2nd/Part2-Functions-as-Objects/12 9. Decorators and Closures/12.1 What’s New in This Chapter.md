# What’s New in This Chapter

The caching decorator `functools.cache`—new in Python 3.9—is simpler than the traditional `functools.lru_cache`, so I present it first. The latter is covered in [“Using lru_cache”](#lru_cache_sec), including the simplified form added in Python 3.8.

[“Single Dispatch Generic Functions”](#generic_functions) was expanded and now uses type hints, the preferred way to use `functools.singledispatch` since Python 3.7.

[“Parameterized Decorators”](#parameterized_dec_sec) now includes a class-based example, [Example 9-27](#clockdeco_param_cls_ex).

I moved [Chapter 10, “Design Patterns with First-Class Functions”](ch10.html#rethinking_design_patterns) to the end of [Part II](part02.html#function_objects_part) to improve the flow of the book. [“Decorator-Enhanced Strategy Pattern”](ch10.html#decorated_strategy) is now in that chapter, along with other variations of the Strategy design pattern using callables.

We start with a very gentle introduction to decorators, and then proceed with the rest of the items listed in the chapter opening.
