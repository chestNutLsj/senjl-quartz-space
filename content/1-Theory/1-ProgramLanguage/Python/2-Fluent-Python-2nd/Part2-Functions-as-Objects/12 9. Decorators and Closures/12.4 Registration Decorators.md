# Registration Decorators

Considering how decorators are commonly employed in real code, [Example 9-2](#registration_ex) is unusual in two ways:

- The decorator function is defined in the same module as the decorated functions. A real decorator is usually defined in one module and applied to functions in other modules.
    
- The `register` decorator returns the same function passed as an argument. In practice, most decorators define an inner function and return it.
    

Even though the `register` decorator in [Example 9-2](#registration_ex) returns the decorated function unchanged, that technique is not useless. Similar decorators are used in many Python frameworks to add functions to some central registry—for example, a registry mapping URL patterns to functions that generate HTTP responses. Such registration decorators may or may not change the decorated function.

We will see a registration decorator applied in [“Decorator-Enhanced Strategy Pattern”](ch10.html#decorated_strategy) ([Chapter 10](ch10.html#rethinking_design_patterns)).

Most decorators do change the decorated function. They usually do it by defining an inner function and returning it to replace the decorated function. Code that uses inner functions almost always depends on closures to operate correctly. To understand closures, we need to take a step back and review how variable scopes work in Python.
