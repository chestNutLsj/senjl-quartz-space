# Chapter Summary

As Peter Norvig pointed out a couple of years after the classic _Design Patterns_ book appeared, “16 of 23 patterns have qualitatively simpler implementation in Lisp or Dylan than in C++ for at least some uses of each pattern” (slide 9 of Norvig’s [“Design Patterns in Dynamic Languages” presentation](https://fpy.li/10-4)). Python shares some of the dynamic features of the Lisp and Dylan languages, in particular, first-class functions, our focus in this part of the book.

From the same talk quoted at the start of this chapter, in reflecting on the 20th anniversary of _Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software_, Ralph Johnson has stated that one of the failings of the book is: “Too much emphasis on patterns as end-points instead of steps in the design process.”[^7] In this chapter, we used the Strategy pattern as a starting point: a working solution that we could simplify using first-class functions.

In many cases, functions or callable objects provide a more natural way of implementing callbacks in Python than mimicking the Strategy or the Command patterns as described by Gamma, Helm, Johnson, and Vlissides in _Design Patterns_. The refactoring of Strategy and the discussion of Command in this chapter are examples of a more general insight: sometimes you may encounter a design pattern or an API that requires that components implement an interface with a single method, and that method has a generic-sounding name such as “execute,” “run,” or “do_it.” Such patterns or APIs often can be implemented with less boilerplate code in Python using functions as first-class objects.
