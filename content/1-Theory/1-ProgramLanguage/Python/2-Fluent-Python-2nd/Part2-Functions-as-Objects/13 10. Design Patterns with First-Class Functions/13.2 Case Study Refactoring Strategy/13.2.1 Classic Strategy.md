## Classic Strategy

The UML class diagram in [Figure 10-1](#strategy_uml) depicts an arrangement of classes that exemplifies the Strategy pattern.

###### Figure 10-1. UML class diagram for order discount processing implemented with the Strategy design pattern.

The Strategy pattern is summarized like this in _Design Patterns_:

> Define a family of algorithms, encapsulate each one, and make them interchangeable. Strategy lets the algorithm vary independently from clients that use it.

A clear example of Strategy applied in the ecommerce domain is computing discounts to orders according to the attributes of the customer or inspection of the ordered items.

Consider an online store with these discount rules:

- Customers with 1,000 or more fidelity points get a global 5% discount per order.
    
- A 10% discount is applied to each line item with 20 or more units in the same order.
    
- Orders with at least 10 distinct items get a 7% global discount.
    

For brevity, let’s assume that only one discount may be applied to an order.

The UML class diagram for the Strategy pattern is depicted in [Figure 10-1](#strategy_uml). Its participants are:

Context

Provides a service by delegating some computation to interchangeable components that implement alternative algorithms. In the ecommerce example, the context is an `Order`, which is configured to apply a promotional discount according to one of several algorithms.

Strategy

The interface common to the components that implement the different algorithms. In our example, this role is played by an abstract class called `Promotion`.

Concrete strategy

One of the concrete subclasses of Strategy. `FidelityPromo`, `BulkPromo`, and `LargeOrderPromo` are the three concrete strategies implemented.

The code in [Example 10-1](#ex_classic_strategy) follows the blueprint in [Figure 10-1](#strategy_uml). As described in _Design Patterns_, the concrete strategy is chosen by the client of the context class. In our example, before instantiating an order, the system would somehow select a promotional discount strategy and pass it to the `Order` constructor. The selection of the strategy is outside the scope of the pattern.

##### Example 10-1. Implementation of the `Order` class with pluggable discount strategies

```
from
```

Note that in [Example 10-1](#ex_classic_strategy), I coded `Promotion` as an abstract base class (ABC) to use the `@abstractmethod` decorator and make the pattern more explicit.

[Example 10-2](#ex_classic_strategy_tests) shows doctests used to demonstrate and verify the operation of a module implementing the rules described earlier.

##### Example 10-2. Sample usage of `Order` class with different promotions applied

```
    >>> joe = Customer('John Doe', 0)  
```

[![^1]

Two customers: `joe` has 0 fidelity points, `ann` has 1,100.

[![^2]

One shopping cart with three line items.

[![^3]

The `FidelityPromo` promotion gives no discount to `joe`.

[![^4]

`ann` gets a 5% discount because she has at least 1,000 points.

[![^5]

The `banana_cart` has 30 units of the `"banana"` product and 10 apples.

[![^6]

Thanks to the `BulkItemPromo`, `joe` gets a $1.50 discount on the bananas.

[![^7]

`long_cart` has 10 different items at $1.00 each.

[![^8]

`joe` gets a 7% discount on the whole order because of `LargerOrderPromo`.

[Example 10-1](#ex_classic_strategy) works perfectly well, but the same functionality can be implemented with less code in Python by using functions as objects. The next section shows how.
