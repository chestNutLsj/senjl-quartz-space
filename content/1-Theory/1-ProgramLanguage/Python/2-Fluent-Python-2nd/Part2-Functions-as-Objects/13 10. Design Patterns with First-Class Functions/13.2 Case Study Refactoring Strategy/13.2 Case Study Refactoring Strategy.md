# Case Study: Refactoring Strategy

Strategy is a good example of a design pattern that can be simpler in Python if you leverage functions as first-class objects. In the following section, we describe and implement Strategy using the “classic” structure described in _Design Patterns_. If you are familiar with the classic pattern, you can skip to [“Function-Oriented Strategy”](#pythonic_strategy) where we refactor the code using functions, significantly reducing the line count.
