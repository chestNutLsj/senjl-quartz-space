# Higher-Order Functions

A function that takes a function as an argument or returns a function as the result is a _higher-order function_. One example is `map`, shown in [Example 7-2](#func_object_demo2). Another is the built-in function `sorted`: the optional `key` argument lets you provide a function to be applied to each item for sorting, as we saw in [“list.sort Versus the sorted Built-In”](ch02.html#sort_x_sorted). For example, to sort a list of words by length, pass the `len` function as the `key`, as in [Example 7-3](#higher_order_sort).

##### Example 7-3. Sorting a list of words by length

```
>>> 
```

Any one-argument function can be used as the key. For example, to create a rhyme dictionary it might be useful to sort each word spelled backward. In [Example 7-4](#higher_order_sort_reverse), note that the words in the list are not changed at all; only their reversed spelling is used as the sort criterion, so that the berries appear together.

```
>>> 
```

In the functional programming paradigm, some of the best known higher-order functions are `map`, `filter`, `reduce`, and `apply`. The `apply` function was deprecated in Python 2.3 and removed in Python 3 because it’s no longer necessary. If you need to call a function with a dynamic set of arguments, you can write `fn(*args, **kwargs)` instead of `apply(fn, args, kwargs)`.

The `map`, `filter`, and `reduce` higher-order functions are still around, but better alternatives are available for most of their use cases, as the next section shows.
