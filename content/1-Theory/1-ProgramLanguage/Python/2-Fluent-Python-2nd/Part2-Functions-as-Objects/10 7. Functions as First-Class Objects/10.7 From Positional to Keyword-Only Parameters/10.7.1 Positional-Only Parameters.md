## Positional-Only Parameters

Since Python 3.8, user-defined function signatures may specify positional-only parameters. This feature always existed for built-in functions, such as `divmod(a, b)`, which can only be called with positional parameters, and not as `divmod(a=10, b=4)`.

To define a function requiring positional-only parameters, use `/` in the parameter list.

This example from [“What’s New In Python 3.8”](https://fpy.li/7-7) shows how to emulate the `divmod` built-in function:

```
def
```

All arguments to the left of the `/` are positional-only. After the `/`, you may specify other arguments, which work as usual.

###### Warning

The `/` in the parameter list is a syntax error in Python 3.7 or earlier.

For example, consider the `tag` function from [Example 7-9](#tagger_ex). If we want the `name` parameter to be positional only, we can add a `/` after it in the function signature, like this:

```
def
```

You can find other examples of positional-only parameters in [“What’s New In Python 3.8”](https://fpy.li/7-7) and in [PEP 570](https://fpy.li/pep570).

After diving into Python’s flexible argument declaration features, the remainder of this chapter covers the most useful packages in the standard library for programming in a functional style.
