# What’s New in This Chapter

The section [“The Nine Flavors of Callable Objects”](#flavors_of_callables) was titled “The Seven Flavors of Callable Objects” in the first edition of this book. The new callables are native coroutines and asynchronous generators, introduced in Python 3.5 and 3.6, respectively. Both are covered in [Chapter 21](ch21.html#async_ch), but they are mentioned here along with the other callables for completeness.

[“Positional-Only Parameters”](#positional_only_params) is a new section, covering a feature added in Python 3.8.

I moved the discussion of runtime access to function annotations to [“Reading Type Hints at Runtime”](ch15.html#runtime_annot_sec). When I wrote the first edition, [PEP 484—Type Hints](https://fpy.li/pep484) was still under consideration, and people used annotations in different ways. Since Python 3.5, annotations should conform to PEP 484. Therefore, the best place to cover them is when discussing type hints.

###### Note

The first edition of this book had sections about the introspection of function objects that were too low-level and distracted from the main subject of this chapter. I merged those sections into a post titled [“Introspection of Function Parameters” at _fluentpython.com_](https://fpy.li/7-2).

Now let’s see why Python functions are full-fledged objects.
