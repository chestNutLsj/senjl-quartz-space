### The fall of the numeric tower

The [`numbers`](https://fpy.li/8-24) package defines the so-called _numeric tower_ described in [PEP 3141—A Type Hierarchy for Numbers](https://fpy.li/pep3141). The tower is linear hierarchy of ABCs, with `Number` at the top:

- `Number`
    
- `Complex`
    
- `Real`
    
- `Rational`
    
- `Integral`
    

Those ABCs work perfectly well for runtime type checking, but they are not supported for static type checking. The [“Numeric Tower”](https://fpy.li/cardxvi) section of PEP 484 rejects the `numbers` ABCs and dictates that the built-in types `complex`, `float`, and `int` should be treated as special cases, as explained in [“int Is Consistent-With complex”](#int_complex_tip).

We’ll come back to this issue in [“The numbers ABCs and Numeric Protocols”](ch13.html#numbers_abc_proto_sec), in [Chapter 13](ch13.html#ifaces_prot_abc), which is devoted to contrasting protocols and ABCs.

In practice, if you want to annotate numeric arguments for static type checking, you have a few options:

1. Use one of the concrete types `int`, `float`, or `complex`—as recommended by PEP 488.
    
2. Declare a union type like `Union[float, Decimal, Fraction]`.
    
3. If you want to avoid hardcoding concrete types, use numeric protocols like `SupportsFloat`, covered in [“Runtime Checkable Static Protocols”](ch13.html#runtime_checkable_proto_sec).
    

The upcoming section [“Static Protocols”](#protocols_in_fn) is a prerequisite for understanding the numeric protocols.

Meanwhile, let’s get to one of the most useful ABCs for type hints: `Iterable`.
