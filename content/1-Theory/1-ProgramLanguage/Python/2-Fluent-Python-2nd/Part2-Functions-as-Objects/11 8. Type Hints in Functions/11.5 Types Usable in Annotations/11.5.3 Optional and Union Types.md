## Optional and Union Types

We saw the `Optional` special type in [“Using None as a Default”](#dealing_with_none_sec). It solves the problem of having `None` as a default, as in this example from that section:

```
from
```

The construct `Optional[str]` is actually a shortcut for `Union[str, None]`, which means the type of `plural` may be `str` or `None`.

# Better Syntax for Optional and Union in Python 3.10

We can write `str | bytes` instead of `Union[str, bytes]` since Python 3.10. It’s less typing, and there’s no need to import `Optional` or `Union` from `typing`. Contrast the old and new syntax for the type hint of the `plural` parameter of `show_count`:

```
plural
```

The `|` operator also works with `isinstance` and `issubclass` to build the second argument: `isinstance(x, int | str)`. For more, see [PEP 604—Complementary syntax for Union[]](https://fpy.li/pep604).

The `ord` built-in function’s signature is a simple example of `Union`—it accepts `str` or `bytes`, and returns an `int`:[^8]

```
def
```

Here is an example of a function that takes a `str`, but may return a `str` or a `float`:

```
from
```

If possible, avoid creating functions that return `Union` types, as they put an extra burden on the user—forcing them to check the type of the returned value at runtime to know what to do with it. But the `parse_token` in the preceding code is a reasonable use case in the context of a simple expression evaluator.

###### Tip

In [“Dual-Mode str and bytes APIs”](ch04.html#dual_mode_api_sec), we saw functions that accept either `str` or `bytes` arguments, but return `str` if the argument was `str` or `bytes` if the arguments was `bytes`. In those cases, the return type is determined by the input type, so `Union` is not an accurate solution. To properly annotate such functions, we need a type variable—presented in [“Parameterized Generics and TypeVar”](#param_generics_typevar_sec)—or overloading, which we’ll see in [“Overloaded Signatures”](ch15.html#overload_sec).

`Union[]` requires at least two types. Nested `Union` types have the same effect as a flattened `Union`. So this type hint:

```
Union
```

is the same as:

```
Union
```

`Union` is more useful with types that are not consistent among themselves. For example: `Union[int, float]` is redundant because `int` is _consistent-with_ `float`. If you just use `float` to annotate the parameter, it will accept `int` values as well.
