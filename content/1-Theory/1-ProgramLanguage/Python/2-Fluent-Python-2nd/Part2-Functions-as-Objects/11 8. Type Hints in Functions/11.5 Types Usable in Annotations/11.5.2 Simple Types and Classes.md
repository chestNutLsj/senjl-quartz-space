## Simple Types and Classes

Simple types like `int`, `float`, `str`, and `bytes` may be used directly in type hints. Concrete classes from the standard library, external packages, or user defined—`FrenchDeck`, `Vector2d`, and `Duck`—may also be used in type hints.

Abstract base classes are also useful in type hints. We’ll get back to them as we study collection types, and in [“Abstract Base Classes”](#type_hint_abc_sec).

Among classes, _consistent-with_ is defined like _subtype-of_: a subclass is _consistent-with_ all its superclasses.

However, “practicality beats purity,” so there is an important exception, which I discuss in the following tip.

# int Is Consistent-With complex

There is no nominal subtype relationship between the built-in types `int`, `float`, and `complex`: they are direct subclasses of `object`. But PEP 484 [declares](https://fpy.li/cardxvi) that `int` is _consistent-with_ `float`, and `float` is _consistent-with_ `complex`. It makes sense in practice: `int` implements all operations that `float` does, and `int` implements additional ones as well—bitwise operations like `&`, `|`, `<<`, etc. The end result is: `int` is _consistent-with_ `complex`. For `i = 3`, `i.real` is `3`, and `i.imag` is `0`.
