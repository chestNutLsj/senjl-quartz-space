### Tuples as records with named fields

To annotate a tuple with many fields, or specific types of tuple your code uses in many places, I highly recommend using `typing.NamedTuple`, as seen in [Chapter 5](ch05.html#data_class_ch). [Example 8-12](#geohash_ex_2) shows a variation of [Example 8-11](#geohash_ex_1) with `NamedTuple`.

##### Example 8-12. _coordinates_named.py_ with the `NamedTuple` `Coordinates` and the `geohash` function

As explained in [“Overview of Data Class Builders”](ch05.html#data_class_overview_sec), `typing.NamedTuple` is a factory for `tuple` subclasses, so `Coordinate` is _consistent-with_ `tuple[float, float]` but the reverse is not true—after all, `Coordinate` has extra methods added by `NamedTuple`, like `._asdict()`, and could also have user-defined methods.

In practice, this means that it is type safe to pass a `Coordinate` instance to the `display` function defined in the following:

```
def
```
