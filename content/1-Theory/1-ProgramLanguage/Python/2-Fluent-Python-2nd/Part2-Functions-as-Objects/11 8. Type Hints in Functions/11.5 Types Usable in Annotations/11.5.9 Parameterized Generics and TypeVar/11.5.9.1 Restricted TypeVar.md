### Restricted TypeVar

`TypeVar` accepts extra positional arguments to restrict the type parameter. We can improve the signature of `mode` to accept specific number types, like this:

```
from
```

That’s better than before, and it was the signature for `mode` in the [_statistics.pyi_](https://fpy.li/8-30) stub file on `typeshed` on May 25, 2020.

However, the [`statistics.mode`](https://fpy.li/8-28) documentation includes this example:

```
>>> 
```

In a hurry, we could just add `str` to the `NumberT` definition:

```
NumberT
```

That certainly works, but `NumberT` is badly misnamed if it accepts `str`. More importantly, we can’t keep listing types forever, as we realize `mode` can deal with them. We can do better with another feature of `TypeVar`, introduced next.
