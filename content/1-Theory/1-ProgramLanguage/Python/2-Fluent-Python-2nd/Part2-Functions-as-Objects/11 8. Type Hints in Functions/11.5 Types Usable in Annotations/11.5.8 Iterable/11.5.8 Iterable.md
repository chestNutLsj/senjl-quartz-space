## Iterable

The [`typing.List`](https://fpy.li/8-20) documentation I just quoted recommends `Sequence` and `Iterable` for function parameter type hints.

One example of the `Iterable` argument appears in the `math.fsum` function from the standard library:

```
def
```

# Stub Files and the Typeshed Project

As of Python 3.10, the standard library has no annotations, but Mypy, PyCharm, etc. can find the necessary type hints in the [Typeshed](https://fpy.li/8-26) project, in the form of _stub files_: special source files with a _.pyi_ extension that have annotated function and method signatures, without the implementation—much like header files in C.

The signature for `math.fsum` is in [_/stdlib/2and3/math.pyi_](https://fpy.li/8-27). The leading underscores in `__seq` are a PEP 484 convention for positional-only parameters, explained in [“Annotating Positional Only and Variadic Parameters”](#arbitrary_arguments_sec).

[Example 8-15](#replacer_ex) is another example using an `Iterable` parameter that produces items that are `tuple[str, str]`. Here is how the function is used:

```
>>> 
```

[Example 8-15](#replacer_ex) shows how it’s implemented.

##### Example 8-15. _replacer.py_

`FromTo` is a _type alias_: I assigned `tuple[str, str]` to `FromTo`, to make the signature of `zip_replace` more readable.

[![^2]

`changes` needs to be an `Iterable[FromTo]`; that’s the same as `Iterable[tuple[str, str]]`, but shorter and easier to read.

# Explicit TypeAlias in Python 3.10

[PEP 613—Explicit Type Aliases](https://fpy.li/pep613) introduced a special type, `TypeAlias`, to make the assignments that create type aliases more visible and easier to type check. Starting with Python 3.10, this is the preferred way to create type aliases:
