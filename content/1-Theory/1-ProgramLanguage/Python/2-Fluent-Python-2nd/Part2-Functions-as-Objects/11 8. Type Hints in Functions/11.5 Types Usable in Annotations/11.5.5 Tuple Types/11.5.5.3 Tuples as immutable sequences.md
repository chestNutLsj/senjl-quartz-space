### Tuples as immutable sequences

To annotate tuples of unspecified length that are used as immutable lists, you must specify a single type, followed by a comma and `...` (that’s Python’s ellipsis token, made of three periods, not Unicode `U+2026`—`HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS`).

For example, `tuple[int, ...]` is a tuple with `int` items.

The ellipsis indicates that any number of elements >= 1 is acceptable. There is no way to specify fields of different types for tuples of arbitrary length.

The annotations `stuff: tuple[Any, ...]` and `stuff: tuple` mean the same thing: `stuff` is a tuple of unspecified length with objects of any type.

Here is a `columnize` function that transforms a sequence into a table of rows and cells in the form of a list of tuples with unspecified lengths. This is useful to display items in columns, like this:

```
>>> 
```

[Example 8-13](#columnize_ex) shows the implementation of `columnize`. Note the return type:

```
list
```

##### Example 8-13. _columnize.py_ returns a list of tuples of strings
