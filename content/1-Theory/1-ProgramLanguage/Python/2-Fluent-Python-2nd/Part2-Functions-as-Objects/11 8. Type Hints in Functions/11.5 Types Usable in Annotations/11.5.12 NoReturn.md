## NoReturn

This is a special type used only to annotate the return type of functions that never return. Usually, they exist to raise exceptions. There are dozens of such functions in the standard library.

For example, `sys.exit()` raises `SystemExit` to terminate the Python process.

Its signature in `typeshed` is:

```
def
```

The `__status` parameter is positional only, and it has a default value. Stub files don’t spell out the default values, they use `...` instead. The type of `__status` is `object`, which means it may also be `None`, therefore it would be redundant to mark it `Optional[object]`.

In [Chapter 24](ch24.html#class_metaprog), [Example 24-6](ch24.html#checked_class_bottom_ex) uses `NoReturn` in the `__flag_unknown_attrs`, a method designed to produce a user-friendly and comprehensive error message, and then raise `AttributeError`.

The last section in this epic chapter is about positional and variadic parameters.
