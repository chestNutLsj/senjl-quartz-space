# What’s New in This Chapter

Most of the updates to this chapter were motivated by a discussion of `@functools.cached_property` (introduced in Python 3.8), as well as the combined use of `@property` with `@functools.cache` (new in 3.9). This affected the code for the `Record` and `Event` classes that appear in [“Computed Properties”](#computed_props_sec). I also added a refactoring to leverage the [PEP 412—Key-Sharing Dictionary](https://fpy.li/pep412) optimization.

To highlight more relevant features while keeping the examples readable, I removed some nonessential code—merging the old `DbRecord` class into `Record`, replacing `shelve.Shelve` with a `dict`, and deleting the logic to download the OSCON dataset—which the examples now read from a local file included in the [_Fluent Python_ code repository](https://fpy.li/code).
