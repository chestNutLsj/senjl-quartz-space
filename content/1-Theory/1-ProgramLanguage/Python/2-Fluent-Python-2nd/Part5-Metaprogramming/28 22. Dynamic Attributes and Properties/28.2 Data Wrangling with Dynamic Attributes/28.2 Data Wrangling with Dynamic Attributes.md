# Data Wrangling with Dynamic Attributes

In the next few examples, we’ll leverage dynamic attributes to work with a JSON dataset published by O’Reilly for the OSCON 2014 conference. [Example 22-1](#ex_osconfeed_json) shows four records from that dataset.[^3]

##### Example 22-1. Sample records from osconfeed.json; some field contents abbreviated

```

```

````` ```` ``   [Example 22-1](#ex_osconfeed_json) shows 4 of the 895 records in the JSON file. The entire dataset is a single JSON object with the key `"Schedule"`, and its value is another mapping with four keys: `"conferences"`, `"events"`, `"speakers"`, and `"venues"`. Each of those four keys maps to a list of records. In the full dataset, the `"events"`, `"speakers"`, and `"venues"` lists have dozens or hundreds of records, while `"conferences"` has only that one record shown in [Example 22-1](#ex_osconfeed_json). Every record has a `"serial"` field, which is a unique identifier for the record within the list.  I used Python’s console to explore the dataset, as shown in [Example 22-2](#ex_osconfeed_explore).  ##### Example 22-2.
