# Descriptor Docstring and Overriding Deletion

The docstring of a descriptor class is used to document every instance of the descriptor in the managed class. [Figure 23-4](#descriptor_help_screens) shows the help displays for the `LineItem` class with the `Quantity` and `NonBlank` descriptors from Examples [23-6](#model_v5_sub) and [23-7](#lineitem_class_v5).

That is somewhat unsatisfactory. In the case of `LineItem`, it would be good to add, for example, the information that `weight` must be in kilograms. That would be trivial with properties, because each property handles a specific managed attribute. But with descriptors, the same `Quantity` descriptor class is used for `weight` and `price`.[^10]

The second detail we discussed with properties, but have not addressed with descriptors, is handling attempts to delete a managed attribute. That can be done by implementing a `__delete__` method alongside or instead of the usual `__get__` and/or `__set__` in the descriptor class. I deliberately omitted coverage of `__delete__` because I believe real-world usage is rare. If you need this, please see the [“Implementing Descriptors”](https://fpy.li/23-2) section of the [Python Data Model documentation](https://fpy.li/dtmodel). Coding a silly descriptor class with `__delete__` is left as an exercise to the leisurely reader.
