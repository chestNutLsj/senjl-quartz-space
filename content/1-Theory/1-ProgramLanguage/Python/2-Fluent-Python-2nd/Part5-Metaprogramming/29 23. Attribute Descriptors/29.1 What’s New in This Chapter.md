# What’s New in This Chapter

The `Quantity` descriptor example in [“LineItem Take #4: Automatic Naming of Storage Attributes”](#auto_storage_sec) was dramatically simplified thanks to the `__set_name__` special method added to the descriptor protocol in Python 3.6.

I removed the property factory example formerly in [“LineItem Take #4: Automatic Naming of Storage Attributes”](#auto_storage_sec) because it became irrelevant: the point was to show an alternative way of solving the `Quantity` problem, but with the addition of `__set_name__`, the descriptor solution becomes much simpler.

The `AutoStorage` class that used to appear in [“LineItem Take #5: A New Descriptor Type”](#new_descr_type_sec) is also gone because `__set_name__` made it obsolete.
