## LineItem Take #3: A Simple Descriptor

As we said in the introduction, a class implementing a `__get__`, a `__set__`, or a `__delete__` method is a descriptor. You use a descriptor by declaring instances of it as class attributes of another class.

We’ll create a `Quantity` descriptor, and the `LineItem` class will use two instances of `Quantity`: one for managing the `weight` attribute, the other for `price`. A diagram helps, so take a look at [Figure 23-1](#lineitem3_uml).

###### Figure 23-1. UML class diagram for `LineItem` using a descriptor class named `Quantity`. Underlined attributes in UML are class attributes. Note that weight and price are instances of `Quantity` attached to the `LineItem` class, but `LineItem` instances also have their own weight and price attributes where those values are stored.

Note that the word `weight` appears twice in [Figure 23-1](#lineitem3_uml), because there are really two distinct attributes named `weight`: one is a class attribute of `LineItem`, the other is an instance attribute that will exist in each `LineItem` object. This also applies to `price`.
