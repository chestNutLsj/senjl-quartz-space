### Terms to understand descriptors

Implementing and using descriptors involves several components, and it is useful to be precise when naming those components. I will use the following terms and definitions as I describe the examples in this chapter. They will be easier to understand once you see the code, but I wanted to put the definitions up front so you can refer back to them when needed.

Descriptor class

A class implementing the descriptor protocol. That’s `Quantity` in [Figure 23-1](#lineitem3_uml).

Managed class

The class where the descriptor instances are declared as class attributes. In [Figure 23-1](#lineitem3_uml), `LineItem` is the managed class.

Descriptor instance

Each instance of a descriptor class, declared as a class attribute of the managed class. In [Figure 23-1](#lineitem3_uml), each descriptor instance is represented by a composition arrow with an underlined name (the underline means class attribute in UML). The black diamonds touch the `LineItem` class, which contains the descriptor instances.

Managed instance

One instance of the managed class. In this example, `LineItem` instances are the managed instances (they are not shown in the class diagram).

Storage attribute

An attribute of the managed instance that holds the value of a managed attribute for that particular instance. In [Figure 23-1](#lineitem3_uml), the `LineItem` instance attributes `weight` and `price` are the storage attributes. They are distinct from the descriptor instances, which are always class attributes.

Managed attribute

A public attribute in the managed class that is handled by a descriptor instance, with values stored in storage attributes. In other words, a descriptor instance and a storage attribute provide the infrastructure for a managed attribute.

It’s important to realize that `Quantity` instances are class attributes of `LineItem`. This crucial point is highlighted by the mills and gizmos in [Figure 23-2](#lineitem3_uml_mgn).

![UML+MGN class diagram for `Quantity` and `LineItem`](assets/flpy_2302.png)

###### Figure 23-2. UML class diagram annotated with MGN (Mills & Gizmos Notation): classes are mills that produce gizmos—the instances. The `Quantity` mill produces two gizmos with round heads, which are attached to the `LineItem` mill: weight and price. The `LineItem` mill produces rectangular gizmos that have their own weight and price attributes where those values are stored.

##### Introducing Mills & Gizmos Notation

After explaining descriptors many times, I realized UML is not very good at showing relationships involving classes and instances, like the relationship between a managed class and the descriptor instances.[^2], which I use to annotate UML diagrams.

MGN is designed to make very clear the distinction between classes and instances. See [Figure 23-3](#mgn_diagram_demo). In MGN, a class is drawn as a “mill,” a complicated machine that produces gizmos. Classes/mills are always machines with levers and dials. The gizmos are the instances, and they look much simpler. When this book is rendered in color, gizmos have the same color as the mill that made it.

###### Figure 23-3. MGN sketch showing the `LineItem` class making three instances, and `Quantity` making two. One instance of `Quantity` is retrieving a value stored in a `LineItem` instance.

For this example, I drew `LineItem` instances as rows in a tabular invoice, with three cells representing the three attributes (`description`, `weight`, and `price`). Because `Quantity` instances are descriptors, they have a magnifying glass to `__get__` values, and a claw to `__set__` values. When we get to metaclasses, you’ll thank me for these doodles.

Enough doodling for now. Here is the code: [Example 23-1](#quantity_v3) shows the `Quantity` descriptor class, and [Example 23-2](#lineitem_class_v3) lists a new `LineItem` class using two instances of `Quantity`.

##### Example 23-1. bulkfood_v3.py: `Quantity` descriptor does not accept negative values

```
class
```

[![^1]

Descriptor is a protocol-based feature; no subclassing is needed to implement one.

[![^2]

Each `Quantity` instance will have a `storage_name` attribute: that’s the name of the storage attribute to hold the value in the managed instances.

[![^3]

`__set__` is called when there is an attempt to assign to the managed attribute. Here, `self` is the descriptor instance (i.e., `LineItem.weight` or `LineItem.price`), `instance` is the managed instance (a `LineItem` instance), and `value` is the value being assigned.

[![^4]

We must store the attribute value directly into `__dict__`; calling `set​attr​(instance, self.storage_name)` would trigger the `__set__` method again, leading to infinite recursion.

[![^5]

We need to implement `__get__` because the name of the managed attribute may not be the same as the `storage_name`. The `owner` argument will be explained shortly.

Implementing `__get__` is necessary because a user could write something like this:

```
class
```

In the `House` class, the managed attribute is `rooms`, but the storage attribute is `number_of_rooms`. Given a `House` instance named `chaos_manor`, reading and writing `chaos_manor.rooms` goes through the `Quantity` descriptor instance attached to `rooms`, but reading and writing `chaos_manor.number_of_rooms` bypasses the descriptor.

Note that `__get__` receives three arguments: `self`, `instance`, and `owner`. The `owner` argument is a reference to the managed class (e.g., `LineItem`), and it’s useful if you want the descriptor to support retrieving a class attribute—perhaps to emulate Python’s default behavior of retrieving a class attribute when the name is not found in the instance.

If a managed attribute, such as `weight`, is retrieved via the class like `Line​Item.weight`, the descriptor `__get__` method receives `None` as the value for the `instance` argument.

To support introspection and other metaprogramming tricks by the user, it’s a good practice to make `__get__` return the descriptor instance when the managed attribute is accessed through the class. To do that, we’d code `__get__` like this:

    `def` `__get__``(``self``,` `instance``,` `owner``):`
        `if` `instance` `is` `None``:`
            `return` `self`
        `else``:`
            `return` `instance``.``__dict__``[``self``.``storage_name``]`

[Example 23-2](#lineitem_class_v3) demonstrates the use of `Quantity` in `LineItem`.

##### Example 23-2. bulkfood_v3.py: `Quantity` descriptors manage attributes in `LineItem`

```
class
```

[![^1]

The first descriptor instance will manage the `weight` attribute.

[![^2]

The second descriptor instance will manage the `price` attribute.

[![^3]

The rest of the class body is as simple and clean as the original code in _bulkfood_v1.py_ ([Example 22-19](ch22.html#lineitem_class_v1)).

The code in [Example 23-2](#lineitem_class_v3) works as intended, preventing the sale of truffles for $0:[^3]

```
>>> 
```

###### Warning

When coding descriptor `__get__` and `__set__` methods, keep in mind what the `self` and `instance` arguments mean: `self` is the descriptor instance, and `instance` is the managed instance. Descriptors managing instance attributes should store values in the managed instances. That’s why Python provides the `instance` argument to the descriptor methods.

It may be tempting, but wrong, to store the value of each managed attribute in the descriptor instance itself. In other words, in the `__set__` method, instead of coding:

    `instance``.``__dict__``[``self``.``storage_name``]` `=` `value`

the tempting, but bad, alternative would be:

    `self``.``__dict__``[``self``.``storage_name``]` `=` `value`

To understand why this would be wrong, think about the meaning of the first two arguments to `__set__`: `self` and `instance`. Here, `self` is the descriptor instance, which is actually a class attribute of the managed class. You may have thousands of `LineItem` instances in memory at one time, but you’ll only have two instances of the descriptors: the class attributes `LineItem.weight` and `LineItem.price`. So anything you store in the descriptor instances themselves is actually part of a `LineItem` class attribute, and therefore is shared among all `LineItem` instances.

A drawback of [Example 23-2](#lineitem_class_v3) is the need to repeat the names of the attributes when the descriptors are instantiated in the managed class body. It would be nice if the `LineItem` class could be declared like this:

```
class
```

As it stands, [Example 23-2](#lineitem_class_v3) requires naming each `Quantity` explicitly, which is not only inconvenient but dangerous. If a programmer copying and pasting code forgets to edit both names and writes something like `price = Quantity('weight')`, the program will misbehave badly, clobbering the value of `weight` whenever the `price` is set.

The problem is that—as we saw in [Chapter 6](ch06.html#mutability_and_references)—the righthand side of an assignment is executed before the variable exists. The expression `Quantity()` is evaluated to create a descriptor instance, and there is no way the code in the `Quantity` class can guess the name of the variable to which the descriptor will be bound (e.g., `weight` or `price`).

Thankfully, the descriptor protocol now supports the aptly named `__set_name__` special method. We’ll see how to use it next.

###### Note

Automatic naming of a descriptor storage attribute used to be a thorny issue. In the first edition of _Fluent Python_, I devoted several pages and lines of code in this chapter and the next to presenting different solutions, including the use of a class decorator, and then metaclasses in [Chapter 24](ch24.html#class_metaprog). This was greatly simplified in Python 3.6.
