# Descriptor Example: Attribute Validation

As we saw in [“Coding a Property Factory”](ch22.html#coding_prop_factory_sec), a property factory is a way to avoid repetitive coding of getters and setters by applying functional programming patterns. A property factory is a higher-order function that creates a parameterized set of accessor functions and builds a custom property instance from them, with closures to hold settings like the `storage_name`. The object-oriented way of solving the same problem is a descriptor class.

We’ll continue the series of `LineItem` examples where we left off, in [“Coding a Property Factory”](ch22.html#coding_prop_factory_sec), by refactoring the `quantity` property factory into a `Quantity` descriptor class. This will make it easier to use.
