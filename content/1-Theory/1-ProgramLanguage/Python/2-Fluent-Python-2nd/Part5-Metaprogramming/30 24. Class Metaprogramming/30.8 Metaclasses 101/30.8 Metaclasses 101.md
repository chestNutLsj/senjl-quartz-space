# Metaclasses 101

> [Metaclasses] are deeper magic than 99% of users should ever worry about. If you wonder whether you need them, you don’t (the people who actually need them know with certainty that they need them, and don’t need an explanation about why).

A metaclass is a class factory. In contrast with `record_factory` from [Example 24-2](#record_factory_ex), a metaclass is written as a class. In other words, a metaclass is a class whose instances are classes. [Figure 24-1](#meta_class_and_class_mgn) depicts a metaclass using the Mills & Gizmos Notation: a mill producing another mill.

###### Figure 24-1. A metaclass is a class that builds classes.

Consider the Python object model: classes are objects, therefore each class must be an instance of some other class. By default, Python classes are instances of `type`. In other words, `type` is the metaclass for most built-in and user-defined classes:

```
>>> 
```

To avoid infinite regress, the class of `type` is `type`, as the last line shows.

Note that I am not saying that `str` or `LineItem` are subclasses of `type`. What I am saying is that `str` and `LineItem` are instances of `type`. They all are subclasses of `object`. [Figure 24-2](#class_hier_2tops_uml) may help you confront this strange reality.

###### Figure 24-2. Both diagrams are true. The left one emphasizes that `str`, `type`, and `LineItem` are subclasses of object. The right one makes it clear that `str`, `object`, and `LineItem` are instances `type`, because they are all classes.

###### Note

The classes `object` and `type` have a unique relationship: `object` is an instance of `type`, and `type` is a subclass of `object`. This relationship is “magic”: it cannot be expressed in Python because either class would have to exist before the other could be defined. The fact that `type` is an instance of itself is also magical.

The next snippet shows that the class of `collections.Iterable` is `abc.ABCMeta`. Note that `Iterable` is an abstract class, but `ABCMeta` is a concrete class—after all, `Iterable` is an instance of `ABCMeta`:

```
>>> 
```

Ultimately, the class of `ABCMeta` is also `type`. Every class is an instance of `type`, directly or indirectly, but only metaclasses are also subclasses of `type`. That’s the most important relationship to understand metaclasses: a metaclass, such as `ABCMeta`, inherits from `type` the power to construct classes. [Figure 24-3](#metaclass_abcmeta_uml) illustrates this crucial relationship.

![UML class diagrams with `Iterable` and `ABCMeta` relationships.](assets/flpy_2403.png)

###### Figure 24-3. `Iterable` is a subclass of `object` and an instance of `ABCMeta`. Both `object` and `ABCMeta` are instances of type, but the key relationship here is that `ABCMeta` is also a subclass of `type`, because `ABCMeta` is a metaclass. In this diagram, `Iterable` is the only abstract class.

The important takeaway here is that metaclasses are subclasses of `type`, and that’s what makes them work as class factories. A metaclass can customize its instances by implementing special methods, as the next sections demonstrate.
