## Why __init_subclass__ Cannot Configure __slots__

The `__slots__` attribute is only effective if it is one of the entries in the class namespace passed to `type.__new__`. Adding `__slots__` to an existing class has no effect. Python invokes `__init_subclass__` only after the class is built—by then it’s too late to configure `__slots__`. A class decorator can’t configure `__slots__` either, because it is applied even later than `__init_subclass__`. We’ll explore these timing issues in [“What Happens When: Import Time Versus Runtime”](#import_v_runtime_sec).

To configure `__slots__` at runtime, your own code must build the class namespace passed as the last argument of `type.__new__`. To do that, you can write a class factory function, like _record_factory.py_, or you can take the nuclear option and implement a metaclass. We will see how to dynamically configure `__slots__` in [“Metaclasses 101”](#metclass101_sec).

Before [PEP 487](https://fpy.li/pep487) simplified the customization of class creation with `__init_subclass__` in Python 3.7, similar functionality had to be implemented using a class decorator. That’s the focus of the next section.
