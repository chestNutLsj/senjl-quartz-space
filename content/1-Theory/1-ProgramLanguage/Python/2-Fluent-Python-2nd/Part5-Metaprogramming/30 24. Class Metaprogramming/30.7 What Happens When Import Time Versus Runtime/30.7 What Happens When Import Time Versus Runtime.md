# What Happens When: Import Time Versus Runtime

Python programmers talk about “import time” versus “runtime,” but the terms are not strictly defined and there is a gray area between them.

At import time, the interpreter:

1. Parses the source code of a _.py_ module in one pass from top to bottom. This is when a `SyntaxError` may occur.
    
2. Compiles the bytecode to be executed.
    
3. Executes the top-level code of the compiled module.
    

If there is an up-to-date _.pyc_ file available in the local `__pycache__`, parsing and compiling are skipped because the bytecode is ready to run.

Although parsing and compiling are definitely “import time” activities, other things may happen at that time, because almost every statement in Python is executable in the sense that they can potentially run user code and may change the state of the user program.

In particular, the `import` statement is not merely a declaration,[^11]` built-in can be used inside any regular function.

This is all rather abstract and subtle, so let’s do some experiments to see what happens when.
