# A Metaclass Solution for Checked

I don’t want to encourage premature optimization and overengineering, so here is a make-believe scenario to justify rewriting _checkedlib.py_ with `__slots__`, which requires the application of a metaclass. Feel free to skip it.

##### A Bit of Storytelling

Our _checkedlib.py_ using `__init_subclass__` is a company-wide success, and our production servers have millions of instances of `Checked` subclasses in memory at any one time.

Profiling a proof-of-concept, we discover that using `__slots__` will reduce the cloud hosting bill for two reasons:

- Lower memory usage, as `Checked` instances don’t need their own `__dict__`
    
- Higher performance, by removing `__setattr__`, which was created just to block unexpected attributes, but is triggered at instantiation and for all attribute setting before `Field.__set__` is called to do its job
    

The _metaclass/checkedlib.py_ module we’ll study next is a drop-in replacement for _initsub/checkedlib.py_. The doctests embedded in them are identical, as well as the _checkedlib_test.py_ files for _pytest_.

The complexity in _checkedlib.py_ is abstracted away from the user. Here is the source code of a script using the package:

```
from
```

That concise `Movie` class definition leverages three instances of the `Field` validating descriptor, a `__slots__` configuration, five methods inherited from `Checked`, and a metaclass to put it all together. The only visible part of `checkedlib` is the `Checked` base class.

Consider [Figure 24-4](#checkedlib_uml_mgn). The Mills & Gizmos Notation complements the UML class diagram by making the relationship between classes and instances more visible.

For example, a `Movie` class using the new _checkedlib.py_ is an instance of `CheckedMeta`, and a subclass of `Checked`. Also, the `title`, `year`, and `box_office` class attributes of `Movie` are three separate instances of `Field`. Each `Movie` instance has its own `_title`, `_year`, and `_box_office` attributes, to store the values of the corresponding fields.

Now let’s study the code, starting with the `Field` class, shown in [Example 24-21](#checked_field_meta_ex).

The `Field` descriptor class is now a bit different. In the previous examples, each `Field` descriptor instance stored its value in the managed instance using an attribute of the same name. For example, in the `Movie` class, the `title` descriptor stored the field value in a `title` attribute in the managed instance. This made it unnecessary for `Field` to provide a `__get__` method.

However, when a class like `Movie` uses `__slots__`, it cannot have class attributes and instance attributes with the same name. Each descriptor instance is a class attribute, and now we need separate per-instance storage attributes. The code uses the descriptor name prefixed with a single `_`. Therefore `Field` instances have separate `name` and `storage_name` attributes, and we implement `Field.__get__`.

![UML+MGN class diagram for `CheckedMeta`, `Movie` etc.](assets/flpy_2404.png)

###### Figure 24-4. UML class diagram annotated with MGN: the `CheckedMeta` meta-mill builds the `Movie` mill. The `Field` mill builds the `title`, `year`, and `box_office` descriptors, which are class attributes of `Movie`. The per-instance data for the fields is stored in the `_title`, `_year`, and `_box_office` instance attributes of `Movie`. Note the package boundary of `checkedlib`. The developer of `Movie` doesn’t need to grok all the machinery inside _checkedlib.py_.

[Example 24-21](#checked_field_meta_ex) shows the source code for `Field`, with callouts describing only the changes in this version.

##### Example 24-21. metaclass/checkedlib.py: the `Field` descriptor with `storage_name` and `__get__`

```
class
```

[![^1]

Compute `storage_name` from the `name` argument.

[![^2]

If `__get__` gets `None` as the `instance` argument, the descriptor is being read from the managed class itself, not a managed instance. So we return the descriptor.

[![^3]

Otherwise, return the value stored in the attribute named `storage_name`.

[![^4]

`__set__` now uses `setattr` to set or update the managed attribute.

[Example 24-22](#checked_metaclass_ex) shows the code for the metaclass that drives this example.

##### Example 24-22. metaclass/checkedlib.py: the `CheckedMeta` metaclass

```
class
```

[![^1]

`__new__` is the only method implemented in `CheckedMeta`.

[![^2]

Only enhance the class if its `cls_dict` doesn’t include `__slots__`. If `__slots__` is already present, assume it is the `Checked` base class and not a user-defined subclass, and build the class as is.

[![^3]

To get the type hints in prior examples, we used `typing.get_type_hints`, but that requires an existing class as the first argument. At this point, the class we are configuring does not exist yet, so we need to retrieve the `__annotations__` directly from the `cls_dict`—the namespace of the class under construction, which Python passes as the last argument to the metaclass `__new__`.

[![^4]

Iterate over `type_hints` to…

[![^5]

…build a `Field` for each annotated attribute…

[![^6]

…overwrite the corresponding entry in `cls_dict` with the `Field` instance…

[![^7]

…and append the `storage_name` of the field in the list we’ll use to…

[![^8]

…populate the `__slots__` entry in `cls_dict`—the namespace of the class under construction.

[![^9]

Finally, we call `super().__new__`.

The last part of _metaclass/checkedlib.py_ is the `Checked` base class that users of this library will subclass to enhance their classes, like `Movie`.

The code for this version of `Checked` is the same as `Checked` in _initsub/checkedlib.py_ (listed in [Example 24-5](#checked_class_top_ex) and [Example 24-6](#checked_class_bottom_ex)), with three changes:

1. Added an empty `__slots__` to signal to `CheckedMeta.__new__` that this class doesn’t require special processing.
    
2. Removed `__init_subclass__`. Its job is now done by `CheckedMeta.__new__`.
    
3. Removed `__setattr__`. It became redundant because adding `__slots__` to the user-defined class prevents setting undeclared attributes.
    

[Example 24-23](#checked_baseclass_ex) is a complete listing of the final version of `Checked`.

This concludes the third rendering of a class builder with validated descriptors.
