## A Class Can Only Have One Metaclass

If your class declaration involves two or more metaclasses, you will see this puzzling error message:

TypeError: metaclass conflict: the metaclass of a derived class
must be a (non-strict) subclass of the metaclasses of all its bases

This may happen even without multiple inheritance. For example, a declaration like this could trigger that `TypeError`:

```
class
```

We saw that `abc.ABC` is an instance of the `abc.ABCMeta` metaclass. If that `Persistent` metaclass is not itself a subclass of `abc.ABCMeta`, you get a metaclass conflict.

There are two ways of dealing with that error:

- Find some other way of doing what you need to do, while avoiding at least one of the metaclasses involved.
    
- Write your own `PersistentABCMeta` metaclass as a subclass of both `abc.ABCMeta` and `PersistentMeta`, using multiple inheritance, and use that as the only metaclass for `Record`.[^16]
    

###### Tip

I can imagine the solution of the metaclass with two base metaclasses implemented to meet a deadline. In my experience, metaclass programming always takes longer than anticipated, which makes this approach risky before a hard deadline. If you do it and make the deadline, the code may contain subtle bugs. Even in the absence of known bugs, you should consider this approach as technical debt simply because it is hard to understand and maintain.
