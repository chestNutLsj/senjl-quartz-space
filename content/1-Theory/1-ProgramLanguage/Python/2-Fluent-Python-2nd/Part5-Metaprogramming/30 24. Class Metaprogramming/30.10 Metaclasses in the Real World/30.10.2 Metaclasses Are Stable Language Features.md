## Metaclasses Are Stable Language Features

Metaclasses were introduced in Python 2.2 in 2002, together with so-called “new-style classes,” descriptors, and properties.

It is remarkable that the `MetaBunch` example, first posted by Alex Martelli in July 2002, still works in Python 3.9—the only change being the way to specify the metaclass to use, which in Python 3 is done with the syntax `class Bunch(metaclass=MetaBunch):`.

None of the additions I mentioned in [“Modern Features Simplify or Replace Metaclasses”](#metaclass_modern_features_sec) broke existing code using metaclasses. But legacy code using metaclasses can often be simplified by leveraging those features, especially if you can drop support to Python versions before 3.6—which are no longer maintained.
