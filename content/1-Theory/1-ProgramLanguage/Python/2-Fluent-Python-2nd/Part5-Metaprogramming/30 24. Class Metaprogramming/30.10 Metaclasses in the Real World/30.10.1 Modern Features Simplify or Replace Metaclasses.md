## Modern Features Simplify or Replace Metaclasses

Over time, several common use cases of metaclasses were made redundant by new language features:

Class decorators

Simpler to understand than metaclasses, and less likely to cause conflicts with base classes and metaclasses.

`__set_name__`

Avoids the need for custom metaclass logic to automatically set the name of a descriptor.[^15]

`__init_subclass__`

Provides a way to customize class creation that is transparent to the end user and even simpler than a decoratorâ€”but may introduce conflicts in a complex class hierarchy.

Built-in `dict` preserving key insertion order

Eliminated the #1 reason to use `__prepare__`: to provide an `OrderedDict` to store the namespace of the class under construction. Python only calls `__prepare__` on metaclasses, so if you needed to process the class namespace in the order it appears in the source code, you had to use a metaclass before Python 3.6.

As of 2021, every actively maintained version of CPython supports all the features just listed.

I keep advocating these features because I see too much unnecessary complexity in our profession, and metaclasses are a gateway to complexity.
