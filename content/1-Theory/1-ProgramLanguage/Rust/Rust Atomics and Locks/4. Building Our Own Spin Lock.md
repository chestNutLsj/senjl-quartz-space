Locking a regular mutex (see [“Locking: Mutexes and RwLocks”](ch01.xhtml#mutexes)) will put your thread to sleep when the mutex is already locked. This avoids wasting resources while waiting for the lock to be released. If a lock is only ever held for very brief moments of time and the threads locking it can run in parallel on different processor cores, it might be worth it to just repeatedly try to lock it without ever going to sleep.

A spin lock is a mutex that does exactly that. Locking an already locked one will result in _busy-looping_ or _spinning_: repeatedly trying over and over again until it finally succeeds. This can waste processor cycles, but can sometimes result in a lower latency when locking.

###### Note

Many real-world implementations of mutexes, including `std::sync::Mutex` on some platforms, briefly behave like a spin lock before asking the operating system to put a thread to sleep. This is an attempt to combine the best of both worlds, although it depends entirely on the specific use case whether this behavior is beneficial or not.

In this chapter, we’ll build our own `SpinLock` type, applying what we’ve learned in [Chapter 2](ch02.xhtml#atomics) and [Chapter 3](ch03.xhtml#memory-ordering), and see how we can use Rust’s type system to provide a safe and useful interface to the user of our `SpinLock`.

# A Minimal Implementation

Let’s implement such a spin lock from scratch.

The most minimal version is pretty simple, as follows:

```
pub
```

All we need is a single boolean that indicates whether it is locked or not. We use an _atomic_ boolean, since we want more than one thread to be able to interact with it simultaneously.

Then all we need is a constructor function, and the `lock` and `unlock` methods:

```
impl
```

The `locked` boolean starts at `false`, the `lock` swaps that for `true` and keeps trying if it was already `true`, and the `unlock` method just sets it back to `false`.

###### Note

Instead of using a swap operation, we could’ve also used a compare-and-exchange operation to atomically check if the boolean is `false`, and set it to `true` if that’s the case:

```
self
```

It’s a bit more verbose, but depending on your tastes this might be easier to follow, as this more clearly captures the concept of an operation that can fail or succeed. It might also result in slightly different instructions, however, as we’ll see in [Chapter 7](ch07.xhtml#hardware).

Within the `while` loop, we use a _spin loop hint_, which tells the processor that we’re spinning while waiting for something to change. On most major platforms, this hint results in a special instruction that causes the processor core to optimize its behavior for such a situation. For example, it might temporarily slow down or prioritize other useful things it can do. Unlike blocking operations such as `thread::sleep` or `thread::park`, however, a spin loop hint does not cause the operating system to be called to put your thread to sleep in favor of another thread.

###### Tip

In general, it’s good idea to include such a hint in a spin loop. Depending on the situation, it might even be good it to execute this hint several times before attempting to access the atomic variable again. If you care about the last few nanoseconds of performance and want to find the optimal strategy, you’ll have to benchmark your specific use case. Unfortunately, the conclusions of such benchmarks can be highly dependent on the hardware, as we’ll see in [Chapter 7](ch07.xhtml#hardware).

We use acquire and release memory ordering to make sure that every `unlock()` call establishes a happens-before relationship with `lock()` calls that follows. In other words, to make sure that after locking it, we can safely assume that whatever happened during the last time it was locked has already happened. This is the most classic use case of acquire and release ordering: acquiring and releasing a lock.

[Figure 4-1](#happens-before-diagram-spinlock) visualizes a situation where our `SpinLock` is used to protect access to some shared data, with two threads concurrently attempting to acquire the lock. Note how the unlock operation on the first thread forms a happens-before relationship with the lock operation on the second thread, which makes sure the threads cannot access the data concurrently.

# An Unsafe Spin Lock

Our `SpinLock` type above has a fully safe interface, since it, by itself, doesn’t cause any undefined behavior when misused. In most use cases, however, it will be used to protect mutations to a shared variable, which means the user will still have to use unsafe, unchecked, code.

To provide an easier interface, we can change the `lock` method to give us an exclusive reference (`&mut T`) to the data protected by the lock, since in most use cases, it’s the lock operation that guarantees it’s safe to assume exclusive access.

To be able to do that, we will have to change the type to be generic over the type of data it protects, and add a field to hold that data. Since this data can be mutated (or accessed exclusively) even though the spin lock itself is shared, we need to use interior mutability (see [“Interior Mutability”](ch01.xhtml#interior-mutability)), for which we’ll use an `UnsafeCell`:

```
use
```

As a precaution, `UnsafeCell` does not implement `Sync`, which means that our type is now no longer shareable between threads, making it rather useless. To fix that, we need to promise to the compiler that it is actually safe for our type to be shared between threads. However, since the lock can be used to send values of type `T` from one thread to another, we must limit this promise to types that are safe to send between threads. So, we (unsafely) implement `Sync` for `SpinLock<T>` for all `T` that implement `Send`, like this:

```
unsafe
```

Note that we don’t need to require that `T` is `Sync`, because our `SpinLock<T>` will only allow one thread at a time to access the `T` it protects. Only if we were to give multiple threads access at once, like a reader-write lock does for readers, would we (additionally) need to require `T: Sync`.

Next, our `new` function now needs to take a value of type `T`, to initialize that `UnsafeCell` with:

```
impl
```

And then we get to the interesting part: `lock` and `unlock`. The reason we are doing this all, is to be able to return a `&mut T` from `lock()`, such that the user doesn’t require to write unsafe, unchecked, code when using our lock to protect their data. This means that we now have to use unsafe code on our side, within the implementation of `lock`. An `UnsafeCell` can give us a raw pointer to its contents (`*mut T`) through its `.get()` method, which we can convert to a reference within an `unsafe` block, as follows:

```
    
```

Since the function signature of `lock` contains a reference both in its input and output, the lifetimes of the `&self` and `&mut T` have been elided and assumed to be identical. (See “Lifetime Elision” in “Chapter 10: Generic Types, Traits, and Lifetimes” of the Rust Book.) We can make the lifetimes explicit by writing them out manually, like this:

```
    
```

This clearly shows that the lifetime of the returned reference is the same as the one of `&self`. This means that we have claimed that the returned reference is valid as long as the lock itself exists.

If we pretend `unlock()` doesn’t exist, this would be a perfectly safe and sound interface. A `SpinLock` can be locked, resulting in a `&mut T`, and can then never be locked again, which guarantees this exclusive reference is indeed exclusive.

If we try to add the `unlock()` method back, however, we’d need a way to limit the lifetime of the returned reference until the next call to `unlock()`. If the compiler understood English, perhaps this would have worked:

```
    
```

Unfortunately, that’s not valid Rust. Instead of trying to explain this limitation to the compiler, we’ll have to explain it to the user instead. To shift the responsibility to the user, we mark the `unlock` function as `unsafe`, and leave a note for them explaining what they need to do to keep things sound:

```
    
```

# A Safe Interface Using a Lock Guard

To be able to provide a fully safe interface, we need to tie the unlocking operation to the end of the `&mut T`. We can do that by wrapping this reference in our own type that behaves like a reference, but also implements the `Drop` trait to do something when it is dropped.

Such a type is often called a _guard_, as it effectively guards the state of the lock, and stays responsible for that state until it is dropped.

Our `Guard` type will simply contain a reference to the `SpinLock`, such that it can both access its `UnsafeCell` and reset the `AtomicBool` later:

```
pub
```

If we try to compile this, however, the compiler tells us:

error[E0106]: missing lifetime specifier
   --> src/lib.rs
    |
    |         lock: &SpinLock<T>,
    |               ^ expected named lifetime parameter
    |
help: consider introducing a named lifetime parameter
    |
    ~     pub struct Guard<'a, T> {
    |                      ^^^
    ~         lock: &'a SpinLock<T>,
    |                ^^
    |

Apparently, this is not a place where lifetimes can be elided. We have to make explicit that the reference has a limited lifetime, exactly as the compiler suggests:

```
pub
```

This guarantees the `Guard` cannot outlive the `SpinLock`.

Next, we change the `lock` method on our `SpinLock` to return a `Guard`:

```
    
```

Our `Guard` type has no constructor and its field is private, so this is the only way through which the user can obtain a `Guard`. Therefore, we can safely assume that the existence of a `Guard` means that the `SpinLock` has been locked.

To make `Guard<T>` behave like an (exclusive) reference, transparently giving access to the `T`, we have to implement the special `Deref` and `DerefMut` traits as follows:

```
use
```

As the final step, we implement `Drop` for `Guard`, allowing us to completely remove the unsafe `unlock` method:

```
impl
```

And just like that, through the magic of `Drop` and Rust’s type system, we gave our `SpinLock` type a fully safe (and useful) interface.

Let’s try it out:

```
fn
```

The program above demonstrates how easy our `SpinLock` is to use. Thanks to `Deref` and `DerefMut`, we can directly call the `Vec::push` method on the guard. And thanks to `Drop`, we don’t need to worry about unlocking.

Explicitly unlocking is also possible, by calling `drop(g)` to drop the guard. If you try to unlock too early, you’ll see the guard doing its job through a compiler error. For example, if you insert `drop(g);` between the two `push(2)` lines, the second `push` will not compile, since you’ve already dropped `g` at that point:

error[E0382]: borrow of moved value: `g`
   --> src/lib.rs
    |
    |     drop(g);
    |          - value moved here
    |     g.push(2);
    |     ^^^^^^^^^ value borrowed here after move

Thanks to Rust’s type system, we can rest assured that mistakes like this are caught before we can even run our program.

# Summary

- A _spin lock_ is a mutex that busy-loops, or spins, while waiting.
    
- Spinning can reduce latency, but can also be a waste of clockcycles and reduce performance.
    
- A _spin loop hint_, `std::hint::spin_loop()` can be used to inform the processor of a spin loop, which might increase its efficiency.
    
- A `SpinLock<T>` can be implement with just a `AtomicBool` and a `UnsafeCell<T>`, the later of which is necessary for _interior mutability_ (see [“Interior Mutability”](ch01.xhtml#interior-mutability)).
    
- _Acquire and release memory ordering_ are a perfect fit for this use case, necessary to prevent a _data race_ which would result in _undefined behavior_.
    
- When making unchecked assumptions necessary to avoid undefined behavior, the responsibility can be shifted to the caller by making the function `unsafe`.
    
- The `Deref` and `DerefMut` traits can be used to make a type behave like a reference, transparently providing access to methods on an another object.
    
- The `Drop` trait can be used to do something when an object is dropped, such as when it goes out of scope, or when passed to `drop()`.
    
- A _lock guard_ is a useful design pattern of a special type that’s used to represent (safe) access to a locked lock. Such a type usually behaves similar to a reference, thanks to the `Deref` traits, and implements automatic unlocking through the `Drop` trait.
