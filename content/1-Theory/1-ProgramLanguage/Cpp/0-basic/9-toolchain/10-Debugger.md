Debuggers are essential tools for any C++ programmer, as they help in detecting, diagnosing, and fixing bugs in the code. They serve as an invaluable resource in identifying and understanding potential errors in the program.

## Types of Debuggers

There are several debuggers available for use with C++:

- **GDB (GNU Debugger):** This is the most widely used C++ debugger in the Linux environment. It can debug many languages, including C and C++.
    
    Example usage:
    
    ```
    g++ -g main.cpp -o main    # compile the code with debug info
    gdb ./main                 # start gdb session
    b main                     # set a breakpoint at the start of the main function
    run                        # run the program
    next                       # step to the next line
    ```
    
- **LLDB:** This is the debugger developed by LLVM. It supports multiple languages and is popular among macOS and iOS developers.
    
    Example usage:
    
    ```
    clang++ -g main.cpp -o main # compile the code with debug info
    lldb ./main                 # start lldb session
    breakpoint set --name main  # set a breakpoint at the start of the main function
    run                         # run the program
    next                        # step to the next line
    ```
    
- **Microsoft Visual Studio Debugger:** This debugger is built into Visual Studio and is typically used in a graphical interface on Windows systems.
    
    Example usage:
    
    ```
    Open your Visual Studio project and go to Debug > Start Debugging. Then use the step over (F10), step into (F11), or continue (F5) commands to navigate through the code.
    ```
    
- **Intel Debugger (IDB):** This debugger is part of Intel’s parallel development suite and is popular for high-performance applications.
    
- **TotalView Debugger:** Developed by Rogue Wave Software, TotalView Debugger is a commercial debugger designed for parallel, high-performance, and enterprise applications.
    

Each debugger has its advantages and unique features, so it’s essential to choose the one that best suits your needs and works well with your development environment.

## understand debugger messages
Debugger messages are notifications or alerts provided by a debugger to help you identify problems or errors in your C++ code. These messages can be warnings or error messages and can provide helpful information about the state of your program and specific issues encountered during the debugging process.

## Types of Debugger Messages

- **Error Messages:** Notify you about issues in the code that prevent the program from running or compiling correctly. These messages typically include information about the file and the line number where the error is detected, followed by a description of the issue.
    
    Example:
    
    ```
    test.cpp: In function 'int main()':
    test.cpp:6:5: error: 'cout' was not declared in this scope
         cout << "Hello World!";
         ^~~~
    ```
    
- **Warning Messages:** Inform you about potential issues or risky programming practices that may not necessarily cause errors but could lead to problems later on. Like error messages, warning messages usually include information about the file and line number where the issue is found, along with a description of the problem.
    
    Example:
    
    ```
    test.cpp: In function 'int main()':
    test.cpp:6:17: warning: comparison between signed and unsigned integer expressions [-Wsign-compare]
         if (a < size)
                  ^
    ```
    
- **Informational Messages:** Provide general information about the execution of the program, such as breakpoints, watchpoints, and variable values. These messages can also reveal the current state of the program, including the call stack and the list of active threads.
    
    Example (_assuming you are using GDB as debugger_):
    
    ```
    (gdb) break main
    Breakpoint 1 at 0x40055f: file test.cpp, line 5.
    (gdb) run
    Starting program: /path/to/test
    Breakpoint 1, main () at test.cpp:5
    5       int a = 5;
    ```
    

## Code Examples

To make use of debugger messages, you need to employ a debugger, such as GDB or Visual Studio Debugger, and include specific flags during the compilation process.

Example using GDB:

```
// test.cpp

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int num1 = 10;
    int num2 = 0;
    int result = num1 / num2;

    cout << "Result: " << result << endl;

    return 0;
}
```

```
$ g++ -g -o test test.cpp  // Compile with -g flag to include debugging information
$ gdb ./test               // Run the GDB debugger
(gdb) run                  // Execute the program inside GDB
```

At this point, the debugger will show an error message triggered by the division by zero:

```
Program received signal SIGFPE, Arithmetic exception.
0x00005555555546fb in main () at test.cpp:7
7       int result = num1 / num2;
```

Now you can make appropriate changes to fix the issue in your C++ code.

## debugging symbol
Debugger symbols are additional information embedded within the compiled program’s binary code, that help debuggers in understanding the structure, source code, and variable representations at a particular point in the execution process.

There are generally two types of debugging symbols:

- **Internal Debugging Symbols**: These symbols reside within the compiled binary code itself. When using internal debugging symbols, it is essential to note that the size of the binary increases, which may not be desirable for production environments.
    
- **External Debugging Symbols**: The debugging symbols are kept in separate files apart from the binary code, usually with file extensions such as `.pdb` (Program Database) in Windows or `.dSYM` (DWARF Symbol Information) in macOS.
    

## Generating Debugger Symbols

To generate debugger symbols in C++, you need to specify specific options during the compilation process. We will use `g++` compiler as an example.

**Internal Debugging Symbols (g++)**

To create a debug build with internal debugging symbols, use the `-g` flag:

```
g++ -g -o my_program my_program.cpp
```

This command compiles `my_program.cpp` into an executable named `my_program` with internal debugging symbols.

**External Debugging Symbols (g++)**

In case you want to generate a separate file containing debugging symbols, you can use the `-gsplit-dwarf` flag:

```
g++ -g -gsplit-dwarf -o my_program my_program.cpp
```

This command compiles `my_program.cpp` into an executable named `my_program` and generates a separate file named `my_program.dwo` containing the debugging symbols.

When sharing your compiled binary to end-users, you can remove the debugging symbols using the `strip` command:

```
strip --strip-debug my_program
```

This command removes internal debug symbols, resulting in a smaller binary size while keeping the `.dwo` file for debugging purposes when needed.

Remember that the availability and syntax of these options may vary between different compilers and platforms. Be sure to consult your compiler’s documentation to ensure proper usage of the debugging options.

## winDbg
WinDbg is a powerful debugger for Windows applications, which is included in the Microsoft Windows SDK. It provides an extensive set of features to help you analyze and debug complex programs, kernel mode, and user-mode code. With a user-friendly graphical interface, WinDbg can help in analyzing crash dumps, setting breakpoints, and stepping through code execution.

## Getting Started

To begin using WinDbg, you first need to install it. You can download the [Windows SDK](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/downloads/windows-10-sdk/) and install it to get the WinDbg.

## Loading Symbols

WinDbg relies on symbol files (*.pdb) to provide more useful information about a program’s internal structures, functions, and variables. To load symbols properly, you may need to configure the symbol path:

```
!sym noisy
.sympath SRV*C:\symbols*http://msdl.microsoft.com/download/symbols
.reload /f
```

## Opening Executables and Crash Dumps

To debug an executable using WinDbg, go to `File > Open Executable...`, then locate and open the target program. To analyze a crash dump, use `File > Open Crash Dump...` instead.

## Basic Commands

Some common commands you might use in WinDbg:

- `g`: Execute the program until the next breakpoint or exception
- `bp <address>`: Set a breakpoint at a given address
- `bl`: List all breakpoints
- `bd <breakpoint_id>`: Disable a breakpoint
- `be <breakpoint_id>`: Enable a breakpoint
- `bc <breakpoint_id>`: Clear a breakpoint
- `t`: Single-step through instructions (trace)
- `p`: Step over instructions (proceed)
- `k`: Display call stack
- `dd`: Display memory contents in 4-byte units (double words)
- `da`: Display memory contents as ASCII strings
- `!analyze -v`: Analyze the program state and provide detailed information

## Example Usage

Debugging a simple program:

- Open the executable in WinDbg
- Set a breakpoint using `bp <address>`
- Run the program using `g`
- Once the breakpoint is hit, use `t` or `p` to step through the code
- Try `k` to view the call stack, or `dd`, `da` to inspect memory
- Remove the breakpoint and continue debugging with other commands as needed

Remember that WinDbg has a wealth of commands and functionality, so it’s essential to get comfortable with the [documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/debugger/debugger-download-tools) and explore the wealth of available resources specific to your debugging tasks.

## GDB
GDB, or the GNU Project Debugger, is a powerful command-line debugger used primarily for C, C++, and other languages. It can help you find runtime errors, examine the program’s execution state, and manipulate the flow to detect and fix bugs easily.

## Getting started with GDB

To start using GDB, you first need to compile your code with the `-g` flag, which includes debugging information in the executable:

```
g++ -g myfile.cpp -o myfile
```

Now, you can load your compiled program into GDB:

```
gdb myfile
```

## Basic GDB Commands

Here are some common GDB commands you’ll find useful when debugging:

- `run`: Start your program.
- `break [function/line number]`: Set a breakpoint at the specified function or line.
- `continue`: Continue the program execution after stopping on a breakpoint.
- `next`: Execute the next line of code, stepping over function calls.
- `step`: Execute the next line of code, entering function calls.
- `print [expression]`: Evaluate an expression in the current context and display its value.
- `backtrace`: Show the current call stack.
- `frame [frame-number]`: Switch to a different stack frame.
- `quit`: Exit GDB.

## Example Usage

Suppose you have a simple `cpp` file called `example.cpp`:

```
#include <iostream>

void my_function(int i) {
  std::cout << "In my_function with i = " << i << std::endl;
}

int main() {
  for (int i = 0; i < 5; ++i) {
    my_function(i);
  }
  return 0;
}
```

First, compile the code with debugging symbols:

```
g++ -g example.cpp -o example
```

Start GDB and load the `example` program:

```
gdb example
```

Set a breakpoint in the `my_function` function and run the program:

```
(gdb) break my_function
(gdb) run
```

Once stopped at the breakpoint, use `next`, `print`, and `continue` to examine the program’s state:

```
(gdb) next
(gdb) print i
(gdb) continue
```

Finally, exit GDB with the `quit` command.

This was just a brief summary of GDB; you can find more details in the [official GDB manual](https://sourceware.org/gdb/current/onlinedocs/gdb/).
