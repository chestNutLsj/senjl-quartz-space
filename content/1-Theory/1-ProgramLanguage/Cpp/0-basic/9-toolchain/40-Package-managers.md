Package managers are tools that automate the process of installing, upgrading, and managing software (libraries, frameworks, and other dependencies) for a programming language, such as C++.

Some popular package managers used in the C++ ecosystem include:

- **Conan**
- **vcpkg**
- **C++ Archive Network (cppan)**

## Conan

[Conan](https://conan.io/) is an open-source, decentralized, cross-platform package manager for C and C++ developers. It simplifies managing dependencies and reusing code, which benefits multi-platform development projects.

For example, installing a library using Conan:

```
conan install poco/1.9.4@
```

## vcpkg

[vcpkg](https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg) is a cross-platform package manager created by Microsoft. It is an open-source library management system for C++ developers to build and manage their projects.

For example, installing a package using vcpkg:

```
./vcpkg install boost:x64-windows
```

## C++ Archive Network (cppan)

[cppan](https://cppan.org/) is a package manager and software repository for C++ developers, simplifying the process of managing and distributing C++ libraries and tools. It’s now part of [build2](https://build2.org/), a build toolchain that provides a package manager.

An example of a `cppan.yml` file:

```
#
# cppan.yml
#

project:
  api_version: 1

  depend:
    - pvt.cppan.demo.sqlite3
    - pvt.cppan.demo.xz_utils.lzma
```

With these package managers, you can streamline your development process and easily manage dependencies in your C++ projects. In addition, you can easily reuse the code in your projects to improve code quality and accelerate development.

## Conan
[Conan](https://conan.io/) is a popular package manager for C and C++ languages and is designed to be cross-platform, extensible, and easy to use. It allows developers to declare, manage, and fetch dependencies while automating the build process. Conan supports various build systems, such as CMake, Visual Studio, MSBuild, and more.

## Installation

To install Conan, you can use pip, the Python package manager:

```
pip install conan
```

## Basic Usage

- Create a `conanfile.txt` file in your project root directory, specifying dependencies you need for your project:

```
[requires]
boost/1.75.0

[generators]
cmake
```

- Run the `conan install` command to fetch and build required dependencies:

```
mkdir build && cd build
conan install ..
```

- Now build your project using your build system, for example CMake:

```
cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
cmake --build .
```

## Creating Packages

To create a package in Conan, you need to write a `conanfile.py` file with package information and build instructions.

Here’s an example:

```
from conans import ConanFile, CMake

class MyLibraryConan(ConanFile):
    name = "MyLibrary"
    version = "0.1"
    license = "MIT"
    url = "https://github.com/username/mylibrary"
    description = "A simple example library"
    settings = "os", "compiler", "build_type", "arch"
    generators = "cmake"

    def build(self):
        cmake = CMake(self)
        cmake.configure(source_folder="src")
        cmake.build()

    def package(self):
        self.copy("*.hpp", dst="include", src="src/include")
        self.copy("*.lib", dst="lib", keep_path=False)
        self.copy("*.dll", dst="bin", keep_path=False)
        self.copy("*.so", dst="lib", keep_path=False)
        self.copy("*.a", dst="lib", keep_path=False)

    def package_info(self):
        self.cpp_info.libs = ["MyLibrary"]
```

With that setup, you can create a package by running:

```
conan create . username/channel
```

This will compile the package and store it in your Conan cache. You can now use this package as a dependency in other projects.

## vcpkg
`vcpkg` is a cross-platform, open-source package manager for C and C++ libraries. Developed by Microsoft, it simplifies the process of acquiring and building open-source libraries for your projects. `vcpkg` supports various platforms including Windows, Linux, and macOS, enabling you to easily manage and integrate external libraries into your projects.

## Installation

To install `vcpkg`, follow these steps:

- Clone the repository:
    
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/Microsoft/vcpkg.git
    ```
    
- Change to the `vcpkg` directory and run the bootstrap script:
    
    - On Windows:
        
        ```
        .\bootstrap-vcpkg.bat
        ```
        
    - On Linux/macOS:
        
        ```
        ./bootstrap-vcpkg.sh
        ```
        
- (Optional) Add the `vcpkg` executable to your `PATH` environment variable for easy access.
    

## Basic usage

Here are some basic examples of using `vcpkg`:

- Search for a package:
    
    ```
    vcpkg search <package_name>
    ```
    
- Install a package:
    
    ```
    vcpkg install <package_name>
    ```
    
- Remove a package:
    
    ```
    vcpkg remove <package_name>
    ```
    
- List installed packages:
    
    ```
    vcpkg list
    ```
    
- Integrate `vcpkg` with Visual Studio (Windows only):
    
    ```
    vcpkg integrate install
    ```
