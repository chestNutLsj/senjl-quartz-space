Code splitting refers to the process of breaking down a large code base into smaller, more manageable files or modules. This helps improve the organization, maintainability, and readability of the code. In C++, code splitting is generally achieved through the use of separate compilation, header files, and source files.

## Header Files (.h or .hpp)

Header files, usually with the `.h` or `.hpp` extension, are responsible for declaring classes, functions, and variables that are needed by multiple source files. They act as an interface between different parts of the code, making it easier to manage dependencies and reduce the chances of duplicated code.

Example of a header file:

```
// example.h
#ifndef EXAMPLE_H
#define EXAMPLE_H

class Example {
public:
    void printMessage();
};

#endif
```

## Source Files (.cpp)

Source files, with the `.cpp` extension, are responsible for implementing the actual functionality defined in the corresponding header files. They include the header files as needed and provide the function and class method definitions.

Example of a source file:

```
// example.cpp
#include "example.h"
#include <iostream>

void Example::printMessage() {
    std::cout << "Hello, code splitting!" << std::endl;
}
```

## Separate Compilation

C++ allows for separate compilation, which means that each source file can be compiled independently into an object file. These object files can then be linked together to form the final executable. This provides faster build times when making changes to a single source file since only that file needs to be recompiled, and the other object files can be reused.

Example of separate compilation and linking:

```
# Compile each source file into an object file
g++ -c main.cpp -o main.o
g++ -c example.cpp -o example.o

# Link object files together to create the executable
g++ main.o example.o -o my_program
```

By following the code splitting technique, you can better organize your C++ codebase, making it more manageable and maintainable.

## Forward Declaration

Forward declaration is a way of declaring a symbol (class, function, or variable) before defining it in the code. It helps the compiler understand the type, size, and existence of the symbol. This declaration is particularly useful when we have cyclic dependencies or to reduce compilation time by avoiding unnecessary header inclusions in the source file.

### Class Forward Declaration

To use a class type before it is defined, you can declare the class without defining its members, like this:

```
class ClassA; // forward declaration
```

You can then use pointers or references to the class in your code before defining the class itself:

```
void do_something (ClassA& obj);

class ClassB {
public:
    void another_function(ClassA& obj);
};
```

However, if you try to make an object of `ClassA` or call its member functions without defining the class, you will get a compilation error.

### Function Forward Declaration

Functions must be declared before using them, and a forward declaration can be used to declare a function without defining it:

```
int add(int a, int b); // forward declaration

int main() {
    int result = add(2, 3);
    return 0;
}

int add(int a, int b) {
    return a + b;
}
```

### Enum and Typedef Forward Declaration

For `enum` and `typedef`, it is not possible to forward declare because they don’t have separate declaration and definition stages.

Keep in mind that forward declarations should be used cautiously, as they can make the code more difficult to understand.
