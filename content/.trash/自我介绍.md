尊敬的各位导师：
您好！
我是栗森杰，来自山西太原，本科毕业于西安电子科技大学计算机学院物联网工程专业。今天在此我非常荣幸有机会向您介绍我自己。我将从本科学习经历、个人技术能力和未来的学术规划三个方面来展开。

在本科期间，我不仅认真学习了物联网工程专业的核心课程，如信息物理系统、无线传感器网络、应用密码学与物联网安全等专业技能，同时，我对计算机科学和人工智能的前沿技术保持着持续的关注和学习热情。我的毕业设计获得了优秀毕业论文提名，并在此期间我还荣获了一次奖学金。

个人能力方面，我比较扎实地掌握了传统机器学习的理论和经典模型，在毕业设计中利用 GBDT、CNN 等模型搭建了恶意软件检测模型。另外我还深入学习深度学习技术，如 RNN、注意力机制等在机器翻译等 NLP 领域的应用，自 ChatGPT 兴起后对 LLM 领域颇感兴趣，于是阅读了诸如 A survey of LLMs 和 Explainability for LLMs: A Survey 等综述论文进行深入了解，并且部署、微调唐杰老师团队的 ChatGLM 模型，积累经验。

未来规划方面，大学的经历让我意识到广而不精地学习有些好高骛远，因此如果能够有幸通过研究生复试被贵校录取，我希望在立足诸位导师优秀的团队基础上深入研究人工智能领域，尤其是在网络协议和安全中的应用、以及 LLM 的内部机制和在多模态生成方面的应用，脚踏实地地做出科研贡献。

以上就是我的自我介绍的全部内容，感谢各位导师的垂听，恳请各位导师斧正。

Dear Mentors: 
Good Morning!

I am Li Senjie, from Taiyuan, Shanxi Province, I graduated from Xidian University, School of Computer Science, majoring in Internet of Things Engineering. I am very honored to have the opportunity to introduce myself to you. I will start from three aspects: undergraduate study experience, personal technical ability and future academic planning.

During my undergraduate years, I not only carefully studied the core courses of IoT engineering, such as information physical systems, wireless sensor networks, applied cryptography and IoT security, and other professional skills, but also maintained my continuous attention and enthusiasm for learning the cutting-edge technologies of computer science and artificial intelligence. My graduation design was nominated for Outstanding Thesis, and I was also honored with a scholarship during this period.

In terms of personal ability, I have a solid grasp of the theory and classical models of traditional machine learning, and built a malware detection model using GBDT, CNN and other models in my graduation design. In addition, I have also learned deep learning techniques, such as RNN, attention mechanism, etc. in the application of machine translation and other NLP fields. Since the emergence of ChatGPT, I have been interested in the LLM field, so I have read the review papers, such as A survey of LLMs and Explainability for LLMs: A Survey, etc., to gain a deeper understanding of the field and to deploy them, We also deployed and fine-tuned the ChatGLM model of Mr. Tang Jie's team to accumulate experience.

As for my future plan, my experience in university has made me realize that it is over-ambitious to study broadly but not precisely, so if I am lucky enough to be admitted to your university after passing the reexamination for graduate students, I would like to base on the excellent team of your supervisors to conduct in-depth research in the field of Artificial Intelligence, especially in the application of network protocols and security, as well as in the internal mechanism of LLMs and the application of multimodal generation, so as to contribute to the scientific research in a down-to-earth way. Contribute to the research.

The above is my self-introduction, thank you for listening to me, and I would like to ask you to correct me.
