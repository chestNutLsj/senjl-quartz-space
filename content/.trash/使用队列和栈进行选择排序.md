Let Q denote a queue containing sixteen numbers and S be an empty stack. Head (Q) returns the element at the head of the queue Q without removing it from Q. Similarly Top (S) returns the element at the top of ยง without removing it from S. Consider the algorithm given below. 

```
while Q is not Empty do
	if S is Empty OR Top (S) <= Head (Q) then
		x:= Dequeue (Q); 
		Push (S, x); 
	else 
		x:=pop (S); 
		Enqueue (Q, x); 
	end 
end 
```
The maximum possible number of iterations of the while loop in the algorithm is ( ).
